Do not adjust the driver’s seat while driving so full attention may be given to vehicle operation. The seat may move suddenly and could cause loss of control of the vehicle. The seatback should not be reclined any more than needed for comfort. Seat belts are most effective when the passenger sits well back and straight up in the seat. If the seatback is reclined, the risk of sliding under the lap belt and being injured is increased.  

# WARNING  

Do not ride in a moving vehicle when the seatback is reclined. This can be dangerous. The shoulder belt will not be against your body. In an accident, you could be thrown into it and receive neck or other serious injuries. You could also slide under the lap belt and receive serious internal injuries. For the most effective protection when the vehicle is in motion, the seat should be upright. Always sit  

well back in the seat with both feet on the floor and adjust the seat belt properly. See “Precautions on seat belt usage” (P.1-15).   
After adjustment, gently rock in the seat to make sure it is securely locked.   
Do not leave children unattended inside the vehicle. They could unknowingly activate switches or controls. Unattended children could become involved in serious accidents.

FRONT SEATS  

# Front manual seat adjustment  

# Forward and backward:  

Pull the lever $\textcircled{1}$ up and hold it while you slide the seat forward or backward to the desired position. Release the lever to lock the seat in position.  

# Reclining:  

To recline the seatback, pull the lever $\textcircled{2}$ up and lean back. To bring the seatback forward, pull the lever up and lean your body forward. Release the lever to lock the seatback in position.  

The reclining feature allows adjustment of the seatback for occupants of different sizes for added comfort and to help obtain proper seat belt fit. (See “Precautions on seat belt usage” (P.1-15).) Also, the seatback can be reclined to allow occupants to rest when the vehicle is stopped and the transmission in the P (Park) position.  

# Seat lifter (if so equipped):  

Pull up or push down the adjusting lever to adjust the seat height until the desired position is achieved.  

Front power seat adjustment  

# Operating tips:  

The power seat motor has an auto-reset overload protection circuit. If the motor stops during operation, wait 30 seconds, then reactivate the switch. Do not operate the power seat switch for a long period of time when the engine is off. This will discharge the battery.  

See “Automatic drive positioner” (P.3-36) for the seat position memory function (if so equipped).  

# ! CAUTION  

When adjusting the seat positions, be sure not to contact any moving parts to avoid possible injuries and/or damages.

# FLEXIBLE SEATING  

# WARNING  

Never allow anyone to ride in the cargo area or on the rear seats when they are in the fold-down position. In a collision, people riding in these areas without proper restraints are more likely to be seriously injured or killed.   
Do not allow people to ride in any area of your vehicle that is not equipped with seats and seat belts. Be sure everyone in your vehicle is in a seat and using a seat belt properly.   
Do not fold down the rear seats when occupants are in the rear seat area or any cargo is on the rear seats.   
Head restraints and headrests should be adjusted properly as they may provide significant protection against injury in an accident. Always replace and adjust them properly if they have been removed for any reason.  

If the head restraints/headrests are removed for any reason, they should be securely stored to prevent them from causing injury to passengers or damage to the vehicle in case of sudden braking or an accident. When returning the seatbacks to the upright position, be certain they are completely secured in the latched position. If they are not completely secured, passengers may be injured in an accident or sudden stop. Properly secure all cargo to help prevent it from sliding or shifting. Do not place cargo higher than the seatbacks. In a sudden stop or collision, unsecured cargo could cause personal injury.

# FRONT-SEAT ACTIVE HEAD RESTRAINT  

The Active Head Restraint moves forward utilizing the force that the seatback receives from the occupant in a rear-end collision. The movement of the head restraint helps support the occupant’s head by reducing its backward movement and helping absorb some of the forces that may lead to whiplash-type injuries.  

Active Head Restraints are effective for collisions at low to medium speeds in which it is said that whiplash injury occurs most.  

Active Head Restraints operate only in certain rear-end collisions. After the collision, the head restraints return to their original position.  

Adjust the Active Head Restraints properly as described earlier in this section.  

# SEAT BELTS  

# PRECAUTIONS ON SEAT BELT USAGE  

If you are wearing your seat belt properly adjusted, and you are sitting upright and well back in your seat with both feet on the floor, your chances of being injured or killed in an accident and/or the severity of injury may be greatly reduced. NISSAN strongly encourages you and all of your passengers to buckle up every time you drive, even if your seating position includes a supplemental air bag.  

Most U.S. states and Canadian provinces or territories specify that seat belts be worn at all times when a vehicle is being driven.  

![](images/8bc33a43bb42b4760aef31d7bc9563892278d85f92309f9970467a982387a2ba.jpg)  

# WARNING  

Every person who drives or rides in this vehicle should use a seat belt at all times. Children should be properly restrained in the rear seat and, if appropriate, in a child restraint. The seat belt should be properly adjusted to a snug fit. Failure to do so may reduce the effectiveness of the entire restraint system and increase the chance or severity of injury in an accident. Serious injury or death can occur if the seat belt is not worn properly.   
Always route the shoulder belt over your shoulder and across your chest. Never put the belt behind your back, under your arm or across your neck. The belt should be away from your face and neck, but not falling off your shoulder.   
Position the lap belt as low and snug as possible AROUND THE HIPS, NOT THE WAIST. A lap belt worn too high could increase the risk of internal injuries in an accident. Be sure the seat belt tongue is securely fastened to the proper buckle.   
Do not wear the seat belt inside out or twisted. Doing so may reduce its effectiveness.   
Do not allow more than one person to use the same seat belt.   
Never carry more people in the vehicle than there are seat belts. If the seat belt warning light glows continuously while the ignition is turned ON with all doors closed and all seat belts fastened, it may indicate a malfunction in the system. Have the system checked by a NISSAN dealer.   
No changes should be made to the seat belt system. For example, do not modify the seat belt, add material or install devices that may change the seat belt routing or tension. Doing so may affect the operation of the seat belt system. Modifying or tampering with the seat belt system may result in serious personal injury. Once a seat belt pretensioner has activated, it cannot be reused and must be replaced together with the retractor. See a NISSAN dealer. Removal and installation of the pretensioner seat belt system components should be done by a NISSAN dealer.   
All seat belt assemblies, including retractors and attaching hardware, should be inspected after any collision by a NISSAN dealer. NISSAN recommends that all seat belt assemblies in use during a collision be replaced unless the collision was minor and the belts show no damage and continue to operate properly. Seat belt assemblies not in use during a collision should also be inspected and replaced if either damage or improper operation is noted.   
All child restraints and attaching hardware should be inspected after any collision. Always follow the restraint manufacturer’s inspection instructions and replacement re  

commendations. The child restraints should be replaced if they are damaged.  

![](images/ad4b42f497592ed34168d9eb79961c11520026bd8382ee95add01d4300b1afac.jpg)  

# PREGNANT WOMEN  

NISSAN recommends that pregnant women use seat belts. The seat belt should be worn snug, and always position the lap belt as low as possible around the hips, not the waist, and place the shoulder belt over your shoulder and across your chest. Never run the lap/shoulder belt over your abdominal area. Contact your doctor for specific recommendations.  

# INJURED PERSONS  

NISSAN recommends that injured persons use seat belts, depending on the injury. Check with your doctor for specific recommendations.  

# THREE-POINT TYPE SEAT BELT  

# WARNING  

Every person who drives or rides in this vehicle should use a seat belt at all times. Do not ride in a moving vehicle when the seatback is reclined. This can be dangerous. The shoulder belt will not be against your body. In an accident, you could be thrown into it and receive neck or other serious injuries. You could also slide under the lap belt and receive serious  

internal injuries.  

For the most effective protection when the vehicle is in motion, the seat should be upright. Always sit well back in the seat with both feet on the floor and adjust the seat belt properly.

tongue $\textcircled{1}$ may also be released. Release the connector tongue by inserting a suitable tool (such as a key) into the connector buckle $\textcircled{4}$ . If the seat belt cannot be unbuckled or is already unbuckled, release the child by cutting the seat belt with a suitable tool (such as a knife or scissors) to release the seat belt.  

# WARNING  

Do not allow children to play with the seat belts. Most seating positions are equipped with Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR) mode seat belts. If the seat belt becomes wrapped around a child’s neck with the ALR mode activated, the child can be seriously injured or killed if the seat belt retracts and becomes tight. This can occur even if the vehicle is parked. Unbuckle the seat belt to release the child. For the center of the 3rd row seat, the connector  

![](images/69ccf72cb88d5cc865974c35a54f5dd5aed830b6f9255f98100651fd1375fdc8.jpg)  

Fastening the seat belts  

1. Adjust the seat. (See “Seats” (P.1-2).)  

2. Slowly pull the seat belt out of the retractor and insert the tongue into the buckle until you hear and feel the latch engage.  

. The retractor is designed to lock during a sudden stop or on impact. A slow pulling motion permits the belt to move, and allows you some freedom of movement in the seat. . If the seat belt cannot be pulled from its fully retracted position, firmly pull the belt and release it. Then smoothly pull the belt out of the retractor.  

![](images/e13dda7acdaba8c0be3daa41c2e1c0832b9fbadb1477eb49400b031bc1d62391.jpg)  

3. Position the lap belt portion low and snug on the hips as shown.  

4. Pull the shoulder belt portion toward the retractor to take up extra slack. Be sure the shoulder belt is routed over your shoulder and across your chest.  

The three-point type seat belts have two modes of operation:  

. Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR) . Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR)  

The Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR) mode allows the seat belt to extend and retract to allow the driver and passengers some freedom of movement in the seat. The ELR locks the seat belt when the vehicle slows down rapidly or during impacts.  

The Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR) mode (child restraint mode) locks the seat belt for child restraint installation.  

When the ALR mode is activated the seat belt cannot be extended again until the seat belt tongue is detached from the buckle and fully retracted. The seat belt returns to the ELR mode after the seat belt fully retracts. For additional information, see “Child restraints” (P.1-26).  

The ALR mode should be used only for child restraint installation. During normal seat belt use by an occupant, the ALR mode should not be activated. If it is activated, it may cause uncomfortable seat belt tension.  

# WARNING  

When fastening the seat belts, be certain that seatbacks are completely secured in the latched position. If they are not completely secured, passengers may be injured in an accident or sudden stop.  

![](images/585946943ac09620b8b0c9a2d07a2ebb84ce3f0e45849eee61d5927738fa39cc.jpg)  

Unfastening the seat belts To unfasten the seat belt, push the button on the buckle. The seat belt automatically retracts.  

Checking seat belt operation Seat belt retractors are designed to lock seat belt movement by two separate methods:  

When the belt is pulled quickly from the retractor. When the vehicle slows down rapidly.  

To increase your confidence in the seat belts, check the operation as follows:  

Grasp the shoulder belt and pull forward quickly. The retractor should lock and  

restrict further belt movement. If the retractor does not lock during this check or if you have any question about seat belt operation, see a NISSAN dealer.

# SEAT BELT EXTENDERS  

If, because of body size or driving position, it is not possible to properly fit the lap-shoulder belt and fasten it, an extender that is compatible with the installed seat belts is available that can be purchased. The extender adds approximately 8 in $(200\mathrm{mm})$ of length and may be used for either the driver or front passenger seating position. See a NISSAN dealer for assistance with  

# CHILD SAFETY  

# WARNING  

purchasing an extender if an extender is required.  

Only NISSAN seat belt extenders, made by the same company which made the original equipment seat belts, should be used with the NISSAN seat belts. Adults and children who can use the standard seat belt should not use an extender. Such unnecessary use could result in serious personal injury in the event of an accident. Never use seat belt extenders to install child restraints. If the child restraint is not secured properly, the child could be seriously injured in a collision or a sudden stop.  

# SEAT BELT MAINTENANCE  

To clean the seat belt webbing, apply a mild soap solution or any solution recommended for cleaning upholstery or carpets. Then, wipe with a cloth and allow the seat belts to dry in the shade. Do not allow the seat belts to retract until they are completely dry.  

If dirt builds up in the shoulder belt guide of the seat belt anchors, the seat belts may retract slowly. Wipe the shoulder belt guide with a clean, dry cloth. Periodically check to see that the seat belt and the metal components such as buckles, tongues, retractors, flexible wires and anchors work properly. If loose parts, deterioration, cuts or other damage on the webbing is found, the entire seat belt assembly should be replaced.

# WARNING  

Do not allow children to play with the seat belts. Most seating positions are equipped with Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR) mode seat belts. If the seat belt becomes wrapped around a child’s neck with the ALR mode activated, the child can be seriously injured or killed if the seat belt retracts and becomes tight. This can occur even if the vehicle is parked. Unbuckle the seat belt to release the child. For the center of the 3rd row seat, the connector  

1-24 Safety — Seats, seat belts and supplemental restraint system tongue may also be released. Release the connector tongue $\textcircled{1}$ by inserting a suitable tool (such as a key) into the connector buckle $\textcircled{4}$ . If the seat belt cannot be unbuckled or is already unbuckled, release the child by cutting the seat belt with a suitable tool (such as a knife or scissors) to release the seat belt.  

# Children need adults to help protect them. They need to be properly restrained.  

In addition to the general information in this manual, child safety information is available from many other sources, including doctors, teachers, government traffic safety offices, and community organizations. Every child is different, so be sure to learn the best way to transport your child.  

There are three basic types of child restraint systems:  

. Rear-facing child restraint . Forward-facing child restraint Booster seat  

The proper restraint depends on the child’s size. Generally, infants up to about 1 year and less than 20 lbs $(9\mathsf{k g})$ should be placed in rearfacing child restraints. Forward-facing child restraints are available for children who outgrow rear-facing child restraints and are at least 1 year old. Booster seats are used to help position a vehicle lap/shoulder belt on a child who can no longer use a forward-facing child restraint.  

# WARNING  

Infants and children need special protection. The vehicle’s seat belts may not fit them properly. The shoulder belt may come too close to the face or neck. The lap belt may not fit over their small hip bones. In an accident, an improperly fitting seat belt could cause serious or fatal injury. Always use appropriate child restraints.  

All U.S. states and Canadian provinces or territories require the use of approved child restraints for infants and small children. See “Child restraints” (P.1-26).  

A child restraint may be secured in the vehicle by using either the LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren) system or with the vehicle seat belt. See “Child restraints” (P.1-26) for more information.  

NISSAN recommends that all pre-teens and children be restrained in the rear seat. Studies show that children are safer when  

# properly restrained in the rear seat than in the front seat.  

This is especially important because your vehicle has a supplemental restraint system (Air bag system) for the front passenger. See “Supplemental restraint system” (P.1-48).  

# INFANTS  

Infants up to at least 1 year old should be placed in a rear-facing child restraint. NISSAN recommends that infants be placed in child restraints that comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards or Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. You should choose a child restraint that fits your vehicle and always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for installation and use.  

# SMALL CHILDREN  

Children that are over 1 year old and weigh at least 20 lbs $(\Theta\up k\mathfrak{g})$ should remain in a rear-facing child restraint as long as possible up to the height or weight limit of the child restraint. Children who outgrow the height or weight limit of the rear-facing child restraint and are at least 1 year old should be secured in a forward-facing child restraint with a harness. Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for minimum and maximum weight and height recommendations. NISSAN recommends that small children be  

# CHILD RESTRAINTS  

placed in child restraints that comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards or Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. You should choose a child restraint that fits your vehicle and always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for installation and use.  

# LARGER CHILDREN  

Children should remain in a forward-facing child restraint with a harness until they reach the maximum height or weight limit allowed by the child restraint manufacturer.  

Once a child outgrows the height or weight limit of the harness-equipped forward-facing child restraint, NISSAN recommends that the child be placed in a commercially available booster seat to obtain proper seat belt fit. For a seat belt to fit properly, the booster seat should raise the child so that the shoulder belt is properly positioned across the chest and the top, middle portion of the shoulder. The shoulder belt should not cross the neck or face and should not fall off the shoulder. The lap belt should lie snugly across the lower hips or upper thighs, not the abdomen. A booster seat can only be used in seating positions that have a three-point type seat belt. The booster seat should fit the vehicle seat and have a label certifying that it complies with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards or Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.  

Once the child has grown so the shoulder belt is no longer on or near the face and neck, and the lap belt can be positioned properly across the lower hips or upper thighs, use the seat belt without the booster seat.  

# WARNING  

Never let a child stand or kneel on any seat and do not allow a child in the cargo area. The child could be seriously injured or killed in a sudden stop or collision.

# PRECAUTIONS ON CHILD RESTRAINTS  

# ！ WARNING  

Failure to follow the warnings and instructions for proper use and installation of child restraints could result in serious injury or death of a child or other passengers in a sudden stop or collision:  

— The child restraint must be used and installed properly. Always follow all of the child restraint manufacturer’s instructions for installation and use.  

— Infants and children should never be held on anyone’s lap. Even the strongest adult cannot resist the forces of a collision.  

— Do not put a seat belt around both a child and another passenger.  

— NISSAN recommends that all child restraints be installed in the rear seat. Studies show that children are safer when properly restrained in the rear seat than in the front seat. If you must install a forward-facing child restraint in the front seat, see “Forward-facing child restraint installation using LATCH” (P.1- 37).  

— Even with the NISSAN Advanced Air Bag System, never install a rear-facing child restraint in the front seat. An inflating air bag could seriously injure or kill a child. A rear-facing child restraint must only be used in the rear seat.  

— Be sure to purchase a child restraint that will fit the child and vehicle. Some child restraints may not fit properly in your vehicle.  

— Child restraint anchor points are designed to withstand loads from child restraints that are properly fitted.  

— Never use the anchor points for adult seat belts or harnesses.  

— A child restraint with a top tether strap should not be used in the front passenger seat.  

— Keep seatbacks as upright as possible after fitting the child restraint.  

— Infants and children should always be placed in an appropriate child restraint while in the vehicle.  

When the child restraint is not in use, keep it secured with the LATCH system or a seat belt. In a sudden stop or collision, loose objects can injure occupants or damage the vehicle.  

# CAUTION  

A child restraint in a closed vehicle can become very hot. Check the seating surface and buckles before placing a child in the child restraint.  

This vehicle is equipped with a universal child restraint anchor system, referred to as the LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren) system. Some child restraints include rigid or webbing-mounted attachments that can be connected to these anchors.  

For details, see “Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren System (LATCH)” (P.1-28).  

If you do not have a LATCH compatible child restraint, the vehicle seat belts can be used.  

Several manufacturers offer child restraints for infants and small children of various sizes. When selecting any child restraint, keep the following points in mind:  

Choose only a restraint with a label certifying that it complies with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213 or Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213.   
Check the child restraint in your vehicle to be sure it is compatible with the vehicle’s seat and seat belt system.   
If the child restraint is compatible with your vehicle, place your child in the child restraint and check the various adjustments to be sure the child restraint is compatible with your child. Choose a child restraint that is designed for your child’s height and weight. Always follow all recommended procedures. If the combined weight of the child and child restraint is less than 65 lbs $(29.5~\mathsf{k g})$ , you may use either the LATCH anchors or the seat belt to install the child restraint (not both at the same time).  

If the combined weight of the child and child restraint is greater than 65 lbs $(29.5\mathrm{kg})$ , use the vehicle’s seat belt (not the lower anchors) to install the child restraint. Be sure to follow the child restraint manufacturer’s instructions for installation.  

All U.S. states and Canadian provinces or territories require that infants and small children be restrained in an approved child restraint at all times while the vehicle is being operated. Canadian law requires the top tether strap on forward-facing child restraints be secured to the designated anchor point on the vehicle.

# Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren System (LATCH)  

Your vehicle is equipped with special anchor points that are used with LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren) system compatible child restraints. This system may also be referred to as the ISOFIX or ISOFIX compatible system. With this system, you do not have to use a vehicle seat belt to secure the child restraint unless the combined weight of the child and child restraint exceeds 65 lbs (29.5 $\left|\mathsf{k g}\right\rangle$ . If the combined weight of the child and child restraint is greater than 65 lbs $(29.5\mathrm{kg})$ , use the vehicle’s seat belt (not the lower anchors) to install the child restraint. Be sure to follow the child restraint manufacturer’s instructions for installation.  

The LATCH anchor points are provided to install child restraints in the following positions only:  

. 2nd row seats 3rd row seat (for the right outboard seat only)  

LATCH lower anchor  

# WARNING  

Failure to follow the warnings and instructions for proper use and installation of child restraints could result in serious injury or death of a child or other passengers in a sudden stop or collision:  

Attach LATCH system compatible child restraints only at the locations shown in the illustration. Do not secure a child restraint in the center rear seating position using the LATCH lower anchors. The child restraint will not be secured properly. Inspect the lower anchors by inserting your fingers into the lower anchor area. Feel to make sure there are no obstructions over the anchors such as seat belt webbing or seat cushion material. The child restraint will not be secured properly if the lower anchors are obstructed.  

Child restraint anchorages are designed to withstand only those loads imposed by correctly fitted child restraints. Under no circumstances are they to be used to attach adult seat belts, or other items or equipment to the vehicle. Doing so could damage the child restraint anchorages. The child restraint will not be properly installed using the damaged anchorage, and a child could be seriously injured or killed in a collision.

# TOP TETHER STRAP CHILD RESTRAINT  

If the manufacturer of your child restraint requires the use of a top tether strap, it must be secured to an anchor point.  

# WARNING  

In the 3rd row seat, a child restraint with a top tether strap can only be used in the center and right outboard seating position. Do not place a child restraint with a tether strap in the center and left outboard seating position and attempt to angle the tether strap to the right outboard position. Child restraint anchorages are designed to withstand only those loads imposed by correctly fitted child restraints. Under no circumstances are they to be used to attach adult seat belts, or other items or equipment to the vehicle. Doing so could damage the child restraint anchorages. The child restraint will not be properly installed using the damaged anchorage, and a child could be seriously injured or  

killed in a collision.  

Do not allow cargo to contact the top tether strap when it is attached to the top tether anchor. Properly secure the cargo so it does not contact the top tether strap. Cargo that is not properly secured or cargo that contacts the top tether strap may damage the top tether strap during a collision. Your child could be seriously injured or killed in a collision if the child restraint top tether strap is damaged.  

Top tether anchor point locations  

Anchor points are located in the following locations:  

2nd row seats on the back side of the seatback as shown.   
3rd row seat on the back side of the seatback as shown.  

If you have any questions when installing a top tether strap child restraint on the rear seat, consult a NISSAN dealer for details.  

# REAR-FACING CHILD RESTRAINT INSTALLATION USING LATCH  

Refer to all Warnings and Cautions in the “Child safety” and “Child restraints” sections before installing a child restraint.  

Do not use the lower anchors if the combined weight of the child and the child restraint exceeds 65 lbs $(29.5~\mathsf{k g})$ . If the combined weight of the child and the child restraint is greater than 65 lbs $(29.5~\mathsf{k g})$ , use the vehicle’s seat belt (not the lower anchors) to install the child restraint. Be sure to follow the child restraint manufacturer’s instructions for installation.

Forward-facing (front passenger seat) — step 1  

Refer to all Warnings and Cautions in the “Child safety” and “Child restraints” sections before installing a child restraint.  

Do not use the lower anchors if the combined weight of the child and the child restraint exceeds 65 lbs $(29.5~\mathsf{k g})$ . If the combined weight of the child and the child restraint is greater than 65 lbs, $(29.5~\mathsf{k g})$ use the vehicle’s seat belt (not the lower anchors) to install the child restraint. Be sure to follow the child restraint manufacturer’s instructions for installation.  

Follow these steps to install a forward-facing child restraint using the vehicle seat belt in the rear seats or in the front passenger seat:  

1. If you must install a child restraint in the front seat, it should be placed in a forward-facing direction only. Move the seat to the rearmost position. Child restraints for infants must be used in the rear-facing direction and, therefore, must not be used in the front seat.  

2. Position the child restraint on the seat. Always follow the child restraint manufacturer’s instructions.  

The back of the child restraint should be secured against the vehicle seatback.  

If necessary, adjust or remove the head restraint or headrest to obtain the correct child restraint fit. If the head restraint or headrest is removed, store it in a secure place. Be sure to reinstall the head restraint or headrest when the child restraint is removed. See “Head restraints/headrests” (P.1-10) for head restraint or headrest adjustment, removal and installation information.  

If the seating position does not have an adjustable head restraint or headrest and it is interfering with the proper child restraint fit, try another seating position or a different child restraint.

Forward-facing — step 3  

3. Route the seat belt tongue through the child restraint and insert it into the buckle until you hear and feel the latch engage. Be sure to follow the child restraint manufacturer’s instructions for belt routing.  

If the child restraint is equipped with a top tether strap, route the top tether strap and secure the tether strap to the tether anchor point (rear seat installation only). See “Installing top tether strap (2nd row seats)” (P.1-43) and “Installing top tether strap (3rd row seat)” (P.1-44). Do not install child restraints that require the use of a top tether strap in seating positions that do not have a top tether anchor.  

![](images/c1bb6bad70b571ebd79b17d566f04f9b42e3a7a6a2c9696242cd5a9413f9576e.jpg)  
Forward-facing — step 4  

4. Pull the shoulder belt until the belt is fully extended. At this time, the seat belt retractor is in the Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR) mode (child restraint mode). It reverts to Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR) mode when the seat belt is fully retracted.  

![](images/9bf12999eb40617edb5e804f193439b810ec533a77e52eb56139483a622497d1.jpg)  
Forward-facing — step 5  

5. Allow the seat belt to retract. Pull up on the shoulder belt to remove any slack in the belt.

Forward-facing — step 8  

8. After attaching the child restraint, test it before you place the child in it. Push it from side to side while holding the child restraint near the seat belt path. The child restraint should not move more than 1 inch $(25~\mathrm{mm})$ , from side to side. Try to tug it forward and check to see if the belt holds the restraint in place. If the restraint is not secure, tighten the seat belt as necessary, or put the restraint in another seat and test it again. You may need to try a different child restraint. Not all child restraints fit in all types of vehicles.  

9. Check to make sure the child restraint is properly secured prior to each use. If the seat belt is not locked, repeat steps 2 through 8.

# Forward-facing — step 10  

10. If the child restraint is installed in the front passenger seat, place the ignition switch in the ON position. The front passenger air bag status light should illuminate. If this light is not illuminated, see “Front passenger air bag and status light” in this section. Move the child restraint to another seating position. Have the system checked by a NISSAN dealer.  

After the child restraint is removed and the seat belt is fully retracted, the ALR mode (child restraint mode) is canceled.

Installing top tether strap (2nd row seats)  

# WARNING  

Child restraint anchorages are designed to withstand only those loads imposed by correctly fitted child restraints. Under no circumstances are they to be used to attach adult seat belts, or other items or equipment to the vehicle. Doing so could damage the child restraint anchorages. The child restraint will not be properly installed using the damaged anchorage, and a  

# child could be seriously injured or killed in a collision.  

First, secure the child restraint with the seat belt.  

1. If necessary, raise or remove the head restraint to position the top tether strap over the top of the seatback. If the head restraint is removed, store it in a secure place. Be sure to reinstall the head restraint when the child restraint is removed. See “Head restraints/headrests” (P.1-10) for head restraint adjustment, removal and installation information.   
2. Secure the tether strap to the tether anchor point on the back of each seatback behind the child restraint.   
3. Tighten the tether strap according to the manufacturer’s instructions to remove any slack. Make sure the head restraint does not contact the top tether strap.  

If you have any questions when installing a top tether strap on the rear seat, consult your NISSAN dealer for details.

Installing top tether strap (3rd row seat)  

# WARNING  

In the 3rd row seat, a child restraint with a top tether strap can only be used in the center and right outboard seating position. Do not place in the left outboard seating position and attempt to angle the tether strap to the center or right outboard position. Child restraint anchorages are designed to withstand only those loads imposed by correctly fitted child restraints. Under no circumstances are they to be used to attach adult seat belts, or other items or equipment to the vehicle. Doing so could damage the child restraint anchorages. The child restraint will not be properly installed using the damaged anchorage, and a child could be seriously injured or killed in a collision.  

The center and right side positions of the 3rd row seat are the seating positions that can use a top tether strap.  

First, secure the child restraint with the seat belt.  

1. Position the top tether strap over the top of the center or right outboard seating position seatback.   
2. Secure the tether strap to the tether anchor point on the seatback behind the child restraint.   
3. Refer to the appropriate child restraint installation procedure steps in this section before tightening the tether strap.  

If you have any questions when installing a top tether strap child restraint on the rear seat, consult your NISSAN dealer for de  

tails.  

# BOOSTER SEATS  

Precautions on booster seats  

# WARNING  

If a booster seat and seat belt are not used properly, the risk of a child being injured in a sudden stop or collision greatly increases:  

Make sure the shoulder portion of the belt is away from the child’s face and neck and the lap portion of the belt does not cross the stomach. Make sure the shoulder belt is not behind the child or under the child’s arm.   
A booster seat must only be installed in a seating position that has a lap/shoulder belt.  

![](images/ca89f5005355bfd5988be258e25fc741b46ece77b67db2f1fd69a4692b9cc908.jpg)  

Booster seats of various sizes are offered by several manufacturers. When selecting any booster seat, keep the following points in mind:  

. Choose only a booster seat with a label certifying that it complies with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213 or Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213. Check the booster seat in your vehicle to be sure it is compatible with the vehicle’s seat and seat belt system.  

![](images/d036803cb6308a8656ca4a97a56b6f3c409ad830ff0886cca8761fd6a5fff1f6.jpg)  

Make sure the child’s head will be properly supported by the booster seat or vehicle seat. The seatback must be at or above the center of the child’s ears. For example, if a low back booster seat $\textcircled{1}$ is chosen, the vehicle seatback must be at or above the center of the child’s ears. If the seatback is lower than the center of the child’s ears, a high back booster seat $\textcircled{2}$ should be used. If the booster seat is compatible with your vehicle, place your child in the booster seat and check the various adjustments to be sure the booster seat is compatible with your child. Always follow all recommended procedures.  

![](images/fe66ad1ef7493ea3d679bc6d32a29c28e0d63c969e61af6ac08052db1385ca4c.jpg)  

All U.S. states and Canadian provinces or territories require that infants and small children be restrained in an approved child restraint at all times while the vehicle is being operated.  

The instructions in this section apply to booster seat installation in the rear seats or the front passenger seat.

# SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM  

# PRECAUTIONS ON SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM  

This Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) section contains important information concerning the following systems.  

Driver and passenger supplemental frontimpact air bag (NISSAN Advanced Air Bag System)   
Front seat-mounted side-impact supplemental air bag   
Roof-mounted curtain side-impact supplemental air bag   
Seat belt with pretensioner  

Supplemental front-impact air bag system: The NISSAN Advanced Air Bag System can help cushion the impact force to the head and chest of the driver and front passenger in certain frontal collisions.  

Front seat-mounted side-impact supplemental air bag system: This system can help cushion the impact force to the chest and pelvis area of the driver and front passenger in certain side impact collisions. The supplemental side air bag is designed to inflate on the side where the vehicle is impacted.  

Roof-mounted curtain side-impact supplemental air bag system: This system can help cushion the impact force to the head of occupants in front and rear (2nd and 3rd) outboard seating positions in certain side impact collisions. The curtain air bags are designed to inflate on the side where the vehicle is impacted.  

These supplemental restraint systems are designed to supplement the crash protection provided by the driver and passenger seat belts and are not a substitute for them. Seat belts should always be correctly worn and the occupant seated a suitable distance away from the steering wheel, instrument panel and door finishers. (See “Seat belts” (P.1-15) for instructions and precautions on seat belt usage.)  

The supplemental air bags operate only when the ignition switch is in the ON position.  

After pushing the ignition switch to the ON position, the supplemental air bag warning light illuminates. The supplemental air bag warning light will turn off after about 7 seconds if the systems are operational.  

![](images/59c43d39f989e2ea119160ef2ca5f492bbe46d4bdcd4a677f67f131cf35d663b.jpg)  

# WARNING  

The supplemental front air bags ordinarily will not inflate in the event of a side impact, rear impact, rollover, or lower severity frontal collision. Always wear your seat belts to help reduce the risk or severity of injury in various kinds of accidents.   
The front passenger air bag will not inflate if the passenger air bag status light is lit or if the front passenger seat is unoccupied. See “Front passenger air bag and status light” (P.1-55).   
The seat belts and the front air bags are most effective when you are sitting well back and upright in the seat. The front air bags inflate with great force. Even with the NISSAN Advanced Air Bag System, if you are unrestrained, leaning forward, sitting sideways or out of position in any way, you are at greater risk of injury or death in a crash. You may also receive serious or fatal injuries from the front air bag if you are up against it when it inflates. Always sit  

back against the seatback and as far-away as practical from the steering wheel or instrument panel. Always use the seat belts. The driver and front passenger seat belt buckles are equipped with sensors that detect if the seat belts are fastened. The Advanced Air Bag System monitors the severity of a collision and seat belt usage then inflates the air bags. Failure to properly wear seat belts can increase the risk or severity of injury in an accident. The front passenger seat is equipped with occupant classification sensors (weight sensors) that turn the front passenger air bag OFF under some conditions. This sensor is only used in this seat. Failure to be properly seated and wearing the seat belt can increase the risk or severity of injury in an accident. See “Front passenger air bag and status light” (P.1-55). Keep hands on the outside of the steering wheel. Placing them inside the steering wheel rim could increase the risk of injury if the front  

# air bag inflates.

# WARNING  

Never let children ride unrestrained or extend their hands or face out of the window. Do not attempt to hold them in your lap or arms. Some examples of dangerous riding positions are shown in the illustrations. Children may be severely injured or killed when the front air bags, side air bags or curtain air bags inflate if they are not properly restrained. Pre-teens and children should be properly restrained in the rear seat, if possible.   
Even with the NISSAN Advanced Air Bag System, never install a rearfacing child restraint in the front seat. An inflating front air bag could seriously injure or kill your child. See “Child restraints” (P.1-26) for details.

# WARNING  

Front seat-mounted side-impact supplemental air bags and roof-mounted curtain side-impact supplemental air  

The side-impact and curtain supplemental air bags ordinarily will not inflate in the event of a front impact, rear impact, rollover, or lower severity side collision. Always wear your seat belts to help reduce the risk or severity of injury in various kinds of accidents.  

The seat belts, the side air bags and curtain air bags are most effective when you are sitting well back and upright in the seat. The side air bags and curtain air bags inflate with great force. Do not allow anyone to place their hand, leg or face near the side air bags on the side of the seatback of the front seat or near the side roof rails. Do not allow anyone sitting in the front seats or rear outboard seats to extend their hand out of the window or lean against the door. Some examples of dangerous riding positions are shown in the previous illustrations. When sitting in the rear seat, do not hold onto the seatback of the front seat. If the side air bags inflates, you may be seriously injured. Be especially careful with children, who should always be properly restrained. Some examples of dangerous riding positions are shown in the illustrations. . Do not use seat covers on the front seatbacks. They may interfere with side air bag inflation.

# NISSAN ADVANCED AIR BAG SYSTEM (front seats)  

# WARNING  

To ensure proper operation of the passenger’s advanced air bag system, please observe the following items.  

Do not allow a passenger in the rear seat to push or pull on the seatback pocket.   
Do not place heavy loads heavier than 9 lbs. $(4\upkappa{\bf g})$ on the seatback or in the seatback pocket. Do not hang anything from the head restraint. Do not store cargo behind the seat that can press into the seatback. Do not position the front passenger seat so it contacts the rear seat. If the front seat does contact the rear seat, the air bag system may determine a sensor malfunction has occurred and the front passenger air bag status light may illuminate and the supplemental air bag warning light may flash.   
If a forward facing child restraint is installed in the front passenger seat, do not position the front passenger seat so the child restraint contacts the instrument panel. If the child restraint does contact the instrument panel, the system may determine the seat is occupied and the passenger air bag may deploy in a collision. Also the front passenger air bag status light may not illuminate. See “Child restraints” (P.1-26) for information about installing and using child restraints.   
Confirm the operating condition with the front passenger air bag status light.   
If you notice that the front passenger air bag status light is not operating, please take your vehicle to your NISSAN dealer to check the occupant classification system.   
Until you have confirmed with your dealer that your passenger seat occupant classification system is working properly, position the occupants in the rear seating positions.  

This vehicle is equipped with the NISSAN Advanced Air Bag System for the driver and front passenger seats. This system is designed to meet certification requirements under U.S. regulations. It is also permitted in Canada. All of the information, cautions and warnings in this manual apply and must be followed.  

The driver supplemental front-impact air bag is located in the center of the steering wheel. The passenger supplemental front-impact air bag is mounted in the instrument panel above the glove box. The front air bags are designed to inflate in higher severity frontal collisions, although they may inflate if the forces in another type of collision are similar to those of a higher severity frontal impact. They may not inflate in certain frontal collisions. Vehicle damage (or lack of it) is not always an indication of proper front air bag operation.  

The NISSAN Advanced Air Bag System has dual stage air bag inflators. The system monitors information from the Air bag Control Unit (ACU), seat belt buckle sensors and the occupant classification sensors (weight sensors). Inflator operation is based on the severity of a collision and seat belt usage for the driver. For the front passenger, the occupant classification sensors are also monitored. Based on information from the sensors, only one front air bag may inflate in a crash, depending on the crash severity and whether the front occupants are belted or unbelted. Additionally, the front passenger air bag may be automatically turned OFF under some conditions, depending on the information provided by the occupant classification sensors. If the front passenger air bag is OFF, the passenger air bag status light will be illuminated (if the seat is unoccupied, the light will not be illuminated, but the air bag will be off). (See “Front passenger air bag and status light” (P.1- 55) for further details.) One front air bag inflating does not indicate improper performance of the system.  

If you have any questions about your air bag system, contact NISSAN or a NISSAN dealer. If you are considering modification of your vehicle due to a disability, you may also contact NISSAN. Contact information is contained in the front of this Owner’s Manual.  

When a front air bag inflates, a fairly loud noise may be heard, followed by release of smoke. This smoke is not harmful and does not indicate a fire. Care should be taken not to inhale it, as it may cause irritation and choking. Those with a history of a breathing condition should get fresh air promptly.  

Front air bags, along with the use of seat belts, help to cushion the impact force on the head and chest of the front occupants. They can help save lives and reduce serious injuries. However, an inflating front air bag may cause facial abrasions or other injuries. Front air bags do not provide restraint to the lower body.  

Even with NISSAN advanced air bags, seat belts should be correctly worn and the driver and passenger seated upright as far as practical away from the steering wheel or instrument panel. The front air bags inflate quickly in order to help protect the front occupants. Because of this, the force of the front air bag inflating can increase the risk of injury if the occupant is too close to, or is against, the air bag module during inflation.  

The front air bags deflate quickly after a collision.  

The front air bags operate only when the ignition switch is in the ON position.  

After pushing the ignition switch to the ON position, the supplemental air bag warning light illuminates. The supplemental air bag warning light will turn off after about 7 seconds if the system is operational.

# WARNING  

The front passenger air bag is designed to automatically turn OFF under some conditions. Read this section carefully to learn how it operates. Proper use of the seat, seat belt and child restraints is necessary for most effective protection. Failure to follow all instructions in this manual concerning the use of seats, seat belts and child restraints can increase the risk or severity of injury in  

# an accident.  

# Status light:  

The front passenger air bag status light $\mathbf{\widetilde{\Gamma}}_{u u u}^{v a v a n}\mathbf{\widetilde{\Gamma}}_{p}^{\ast}$ is located on the instrument panel. After the ignition switch is placed in the ON position, the front passenger air bag status light illuminates for about 7 seconds and then turns off or illuminates depending on the front passenger seat occupied status. The light operates as follows:  

The light operates as follows:  

Unoccupied passenger seat: The $\mathbf{\widetilde{\Gamma}}_{u u u}^{v a v a n}\mathbf{\widetilde{\Gamma}}_{p}^{\ast}$ light is OFF and the front passenger air bag is OFF and will not inflate in a crash. Passenger seat occupied by a small adult, child or child restraint as outlined in this section: The light illuminates to indicate that the front passenger air bag is OFF and will not inflate in a crash. . Occupied passenger seat and the passenger meets the conditions outlined in this section: The light is OFF to indicate that the front passenger air bag is operational.  

# Front passenger air bag:  

The front passenger air bag is designed to automatically turn OFF when the vehicle is operated under some conditions as described below as permitted by U.S. regulations. If the front passenger air bag is OFF, it will not inflate in a crash. The driver air bag and other air bags in your vehicle are not part of this system.  

The purpose of the regulation is to help reduce the risk of injury or death from an inflating air bag to certain front passenger seat occupants, such as children, by requiring the air bag to be automatically turned OFF.  

The occupant classification sensors (weight sensors) are on the seat cushion frame under the front passenger seat and are designed to detect an occupant and objects on the seat. For example, if a child is in the front passenger seat, the Advanced Air Bag System is designed to turn the passenger air bag OFF in accordance with the regulations. Also, if a child restraint of the type specified in the regulations is on the seat, the occupant classification sensors can detect it and cause the air bag to turn OFF.  

Front passenger seat adult occupants who are properly seated and using the seat belt as outlined in this manual should not cause the passenger air bag to be automatically turned OFF. For small adults it may be turned OFF, however, if the occupant does not sit in the seat properly (for example, by not sitting upright, by sitting on an edge of the seat, or by otherwise being out of position), this could cause the sensor to turn the air bag OFF. Always be sure to be seated and wearing the seat belt properly for the most effective protection by the seat belt and supplemental air bag.  

NISSAN recommends that pre-teens and children be properly restrained in a rear seat. NISSAN also recommends that appropriate child restraints and booster seats be properly installed in a rear seat. If this is not possible, the occupant classification sensors are designed to operate as described above to turn the front passenger air bag OFF for specified child restraints. Failing to properly secure child restrains and to use the ALR mode may allow the restraint to tip or move in an accident or sudden stop. This can also result in the passenger air bag inflating in a crash instead of being OFF. (See “Child restraints” (P.1-26) for proper use and installation.)  

If the front passenger seat is not occupied, the passenger air bag is designed not to inflate in a crash. However, heavy objects placed on the seat could result in air bag inflation, because of the object being detected by the occupant classification sensors. Other conditions could also result in air bag inflation, such as if a child is standing on the seat, or if two children are on the seat, contrary to the instructions in this manual. Always be sure that you and all vehicle occupants are seated and restrained properly.  

Using the passenger air bag status light, you can monitor when the front passenger air bag is automatically turned OFF with the seat occupied. The light will not illuminate when the front passenger seat is unoccupied.  

If an adult occupant is in the seat but the passenger air bag status light is illuminated (indicating that the air bag is OFF), it could be that the person is a small adult, or is not sitting on the seat properly.  

If a child restraint must be used in the front seat, the passenger air bag status light may or may not be illuminated, depending on the size of the child and the type of child restraint being used. If the passenger air bag status light is not illuminated (indicating that the air bag might inflate in a crash), it could be that the child restraint or seat belt is not being used properly. Make sure that the child restraint is installed properly, the seat belt is used properly and the occupant is positioned properly. If the passenger air bag status light is still not illuminated, reposition the occupant or child restraint in a rear seat.  

If the passenger air bag status light will not illuminate even though you believe that the child restraint, the seat belts and the occupant are properly positioned, the system may be sensing an unoccupied seat (in which case the air bag is  

OFF). Your NISSAN dealer can check that the system is OFF by using a special tool. However, until you have confirmed with your dealer that your air bag is working properly, reposition the occupant or child restraint in a rear seat.  

The NISSAN Advanced Air Bag System and passenger air bag status light will take a few seconds to register a change in the passenger seat status. However, if the seat becomes unoccupied, the air bag status light will remain off.  

If a malfunction occurs in the front passenger air bag system, the supplemental air bag warning light , located in the meter and gauges area will blink. Have the system checked by a NISSAN dealer.  

Other supplemental front-impact air bag precautions  

# WARNING  

Do not place any objects on the steering wheel pad or on the instrument panel. Also, do not place any objects between any occupant and the steering wheel or instrument panel. Such objects may become dangerous projectiles and cause  

injury if the front air bags inflate. Do not place objects with sharp edges on the seat. Also, do not place heavy objects on the seat that will leave permanent impressions in the seat. Such objects can damage the seat or occupant classification sensors (weight sensors). This can affect the operation of the air bag system and result in serious personal injury.   
Do not use water or acidic cleaners (hot steam cleaners) on the seat. This can damage the seat or occupant classification sensors. This can also affect the operation of the air bag system and result in serious personal injury.   
Immediately after inflation, several front air bag system components will be hot. Do not touch them; you may severely burn yourself.   
No unauthorized changes should be made to any components or wiring of the supplemental air bag system. This is to prevent accidental inflation of the supplemental air bag or damage to the supplemental air bag system.  

Do not make unauthorized changes to your vehicle’s electrical system, suspension system or front end structure. This could affect proper operation of the front air bag system. Tampering with the air bag system may result in serious personal injury. Tampering includes changes to the steering wheel and the instrument panel assembly by placing material over the steering wheel pad and above the instrument panel or by installing additional trim material around the air bag system. Removing or modifying the front passenger seat may affect the function of the air bag system and result in serious personal injury. Modifying or tampering with the front passenger seat may result in serious personal injury. For example, do not change the front seats by placing material on the seat cushion or by installing additional trim material, such as seat covers, on the seat that is not specifically designed to assure proper air bag operation. Additionally, do not stow any ob  

jects under the front passenger seat or the seat cushion and seatback. Such objects may interfere with the proper operation of the occupant classification sensors.   
No unauthorized changes should be made to any components or wiring of the seat belt system. This may affect the front air bag system. Tampering with the seat belt system may result in serious personal injury.   
Work on and around the front air bag system should be done by a NISSAN dealer. Installation of electrical equipment should also be done by a NISSAN dealer. The Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) wiring harnesses\* should not be modified or disconnected. Unauthorized electrical test equipment and probing devices should not be used on the air bag system.  

A cracked windshield should be replaced immediately by a qualified repair facility. A cracked windshield could affect the function of the supplemental air bag system.  

# The SRS wiring harness connectors are yellow and orange for easy identification.  

When selling your vehicle, we request that you inform the buyer about the front air bag system and guide the buyer to the appropriate sections in this Owner’s Manual.

# FRONT SEAT-MOUNTED SIDE-IMPACT SUPPLEMENTAL AIR BAG AND ROOF-MOUNTED CURTAIN SIDE-IMPACT SUPPLEMENTAL AIR BAG SYSTEMS  

The side air bags are located in the outside of the seatback of the front seats. The curtain air bags are located in the side roof rails. All of the information, cautions and warnings in this manual apply and must be followed. The side air bags and curtain air bags are designed to inflate in higher severity side collisions, although they may inflate if the forces in another type of collision are similar to those of a higher severity side impact. They are designed to inflate on the side where the vehicle is impacted. They may not inflate in certain side collisions on the side where the vehicle is impacted.  

Vehicle damage (or lack of it) is not always an indication of proper side air bag and curtain air bag operation.  

When side air bags and curtain air bags inflate, a fairly loud noise may be heard, followed by release of smoke. This smoke is not harmful and does not indicate a fire. Care should be taken not to inhale it, as it may cause irritation and choking. Those with a history of a breathing condition should get fresh air promptly.  

Side air bags, along with the use of seat belts, help to cushion the impact force on the chest and pelvis of the front occupants. Curtain air bags help to cushion the impact force to the head of occupants in the front and rear (2nd and 3rd) outboard seating positions. They can help save lives and reduce serious injuries. However, an inflating side air bag or curtain air bag may cause abrasions or other injuries. Side air bags and curtain air bags do not provide restraint to the lower body.  

The seat belts should be correctly worn and the driver and passenger seated upright as far as practical away from the side air bag. Rear seat passengers should be seated as far away as practical from the door finishers and side roof rails. The side air bags and curtain air bags inflate quickly in order to help protect the occupants. Because of this, the force of the side air bags and curtain air bags inflating can increase the risk of injury if the occupant is too close to, or is against, these air bag modules during inflation. The side air bags and curtain air bags will deflate quickly after the collision is over.  

The side air bags and curtain air bags operate only when the ignition switch is in the ON position.  

After pushing the ignition switch to the ON position, the supplemental air bag warning light illuminates. The air bag warning light will turn off after about 7 seconds if the systems are operational.  

# WARNING  

Do not place any objects near the seatback of the front seats. Also, do not place any objects (an umbrella, bag, etc.) between the front door finisher and the front seat. Such objects may become dangerous projectiles and cause injury if side air bag inflates.  

Right after inflation, several side air bags and curtain air bag system components will be hot. Do not touch them; you may severely burn yourself.   
No unauthorized changes should be made to any components or wiring of side air bag and curtain air bags. This is to prevent damage to or accidental inflation of the side air bag and curtain air bag systems. Do not make unauthorized changes to your vehicle’s electrical system, suspension system or side panel. This could affect proper operation of the side air bag and curtain air bag systems.   
Tampering with the air bag system may result in serious personal injury. For example, do not change the front seats by placing material near the seatback or by installing additional trim material, such as seat covers, around the side air bags. Work around and on the side air bag and curtain air bag systems should be done by a NISSAN dealer. Installation of electrical equipment should also be done by a NISSAN  

dealer. The Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) wiring harnesses\* should not be modified or disconnected. Unauthorized electrical test equipment and probing devices should not be used on the sideimpact air bag system.  

# The SRS wiring harness connectors are yellow and orange for easy identification.  

When selling your vehicle, we request that you inform the buyer about the side air bag and curtain air bag systems and guide the buyer to the appropriate sections in this Owner’s Manual.  

# SEAT BELTS WITH PRETENSIONERS (front seats)  

# WARNING  

The pretensioners cannot be reused after activation. They must be replaced together with the retractor and buckle as a unit.   
If the vehicle becomes involved in a collision but a pretensioner is not activated, be sure to have the pretensioner system checked and, if necessary, replaced by a NISSAN dealer. No unauthorized changes should be made to any components or wiring of the pretensioner system. This is to prevent damage to or accidental activation of the pretensioners. Tampering with the pretensioner system may result in serious personal injury.   
Work around and on the pretensioner system should be done by a NISSAN dealer. Installation of electrical equipment should also be done by a NISSAN dealer. Unauthorized electrical test equipment and probing devices should not be used on the pretensioner system. If you need to dispose of a pretensioner or scrap the vehicle, contact a NISSAN dealer. Correct pretensioner disposal procedures are set forth in the appropriate NISSAN Service Manual. Incorrect disposal procedures could cause personal injury.  

The pretensioner system may activate with the supplemental air bag system in certain types of collisions. Working with the seat belt retractor, it helps tighten the seat belt when the vehicle becomes involved in certain types of collisions, helping to restrain front seat occupants.  

The pretensioner is encased with the seat belt retractor. These seat belts are used the same way as conventional seat belts.  

When a pretensioner activates, smoke is released and a loud noise may be heard. The smoke is not harmful, and it does not indicate a fire. Care should be taken not to inhale it as it may cause irritation and choking. Those with a history of a breathing condition should get fresh air promptly.  

After pretensioner activation, load limiters allow the seat belt to release webbing (if necessary) to reduce forces against the chest.  

The supplemental air bag warning light is used to indicate malfunctions in the pretensioner system. (See “Supplemental air bag warning light” (P.1-61) for more details.) If the operation of the supplemental air bag warning light indicates there is a malfunction, have the system checked by a NISSAN dealer.  

When selling your vehicle, we request that you inform the buyer about the pretensioner system and guide the buyer to the appropriate sections in this Owner’s Manual.

# SUPPLEMENTAL AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT  

The supplemental air bag warning light, displaying in the instrument panel, monitors the circuits for the air bag systems, pretensioners and all related wiring.  

When the ignition switch is in the ON position, the supplemental air bag warning light illuminates for about 7 seconds and then turns off. This means the SRS air bag systems are operational.  

If any of the following conditions occur, the air bag and/or pretensioner systems need servicing:  

The supplemental air bag warning light remains on approximately 7 seconds after the ignition switch is pushed to the ON position.   
The supplemental air bag warning light flashes intermittently.   
The supplemental air bag warning light does not come on at all.  

Under these conditions, the air bag and/or pretensioner systems may not operate properly. They must be checked and repaired. Take your vehicle to the nearest NISSAN dealer.  

# WARNING  

If the supplemental air bag warning light is on, it could mean that the front air bag, side air bag and curtain air bag and/or pretensioner systems will not operate in an accident. To help avoid injury to yourself or others, have your vehicle checked by a NISSAN dealer as soon as possible.  

# REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT PROCEDURE  

The front air bags, side air bags and curtain air bags and pretensioners are designed to activate on a one-time-only basis. As a reminder, unless it is damaged, the supplemental air bag warning light will remain illuminated after inflation has occurred. Repair and replacement of these systems should be done only by a NISSAN dealer.  

When maintenance work is required on the vehicle, the front air bags, side air bags and curtain air bags, pretensioners and related parts should be pointed out to the person conducting the maintenance. The ignition switch should always be in the LOCK position when working under the hood or inside the vehicle.  

# WARNING  

# system cannot be repaired.  

Once a front air bag, side air bag or curtain air bag has inflated, the air bag module will not function again and must be replaced. Additionally, the activated pretensioner must also be replaced. The air bag module and pretensioner should be replaced by a NISSAN dealer. The air bag module and pretensioner  

The front air bag, side air bag, curtain air bag and the pretensioner should be inspected by a NISSAN dealer if there is any damage to the front end or side portion of the vehicle. If you need to dispose of a supplemental air bag or pretensioner or scrap the vehicle, contact a NISSAN dealer. Correct supplemental air bag and pretensioner system disposal procedures are set forth in the appropriate NISSAN Service Manual. Incorrect disposal procedures could cause personal injury.

Zone map  

# ZONE VARIATION CHANGE PROCEDURE  

The difference between magnetic north and geographical north is known as variance. In some areas, this difference can sometimes be great enough to cause false compass readings. Follow these instructions to set the variance for your particular location if this happens:  

1. Push the switch for more than 3 seconds. The current zone number will appear in the display.   
2. Find your current location and variance number on the zone map.  

# NOTE: Use zone number 5 for Hawaii.  

3. Push the switch repeatedly until the new zone number appears in the display, then release the switch. After you release the switch, the display will show a compass direction within a few seconds.  

If the compass deviates from the correct indication soon after repeated adjustment, have the compass checked at a NISSAN dealer. . The compass may not indicate the correct compass point in tunnels or while driving up or down a steep hill.  

(The compass returns to the correct compass point when the vehicle moves to an area where the geomagnetism is stabilized.)  

# CAUTION  

Do not install a ski rack, antenna, etc., which are attached to the vehicle by means of a magnet. They affect the operation of the compass. When cleaning the mirror, use a paper towel or similar material dampened with glass cleaner. Do not spray glass cleaner directly on the mirror as it may cause the liquid cleaner to enter the mirror housing.

Your vehicle has two types of security systems, as follows:  

. Vehicle security system NISSAN Vehicle Immobilizer System  

The security condition will be shown by the security indicator light.  

# VEHICLE SECURITY SYSTEM  

The vehicle security system provides visual and audio alarm signals if someone opens the doors or lift gate when the system is armed. It is not, however, a motion detection type system that activates when a vehicle is moved or when a vibration occurs.  

The system helps deter vehicle theft but cannot prevent it, nor can it prevent the theft of interior or exterior vehicle components in all situations. Always secure your vehicle even if parking for a brief period. Never leave your Intelligent Key(s) in the vehicle, and always lock it when unattended. Be aware of your surroundings, and park in secure, well-lit areas whenever possible.  

Many devices offering additional protection, such as component locks, identification markers, and tracking systems, are available at auto supply stores and specialty shops. Your NISSAN dealer may also offer such equipment. Check with your insurance company to see if you may be eligible for discounts for various theft protection features.

# HEADLIGHT AND TURN SIGNALSWITCH  

XENON HEADLIGHTS (if so equipped)  

# WARNING  

# HIGH VOLTAGE  

When xenon headlights are on, they produce a high voltage. To prevent an electric shock, never attempt to modify or disassemble. Always have your xenon headlights replaced at a NISSAN dealer. Xenon headlights provide considerably more light than conventional headlights. If they are not correctly aimed, they might temporarily blind an oncoming driver or the driver ahead of you and cause a serious accident. If headlights are not aimed correctly, immediately take your vehicle to a NISSAN dealer and have the headlights adjusted correctly.  

When the xenon headlight is initially turned on, its brightness or color varies slightly. However, the color and brightness will soon stabilize.  

The life of xenon headlights will be shortened by frequent on-off operation. It is generally desirable not to turn off the headlights for short intervals (for example, when the vehicle stops at a traffic signal). This way the life of the xenon headlights is not reduced.  

If the xenon headlight bulb is close to burning out, the brightness will drastically decrease, the light will start blinking, or the color of the light will become reddish. If one or more of the above signs appear, contact a NISSAN dealer.

Headlight aiming control (if so equipped)  

Depending on the number of occupants in the vehicle and the load it is carrying, the headlight axis may be higher than desired. If the vehicle is traveling on a hilly road, the headlights may directly hit the rearview mirror of the vehicle ahead or the windshield of the oncoming vehicle. The light axis can be lowered with the operation of the switch.  

The larger the number designated on the switch, the lower the axis.  

When traveling with no heavy load or on a flat road, select position 0.  

# WARNING  

Xenon headlights (if so equipped) are extremely bright compared to conventional headlights. If the xenon headlights hit the rearview mirror of the vehicle ahead or the windshield of oncoming vehicle, the driver of these vehicles may have difficulty driving because of the brightness. Use the headlight aiming control switch to lower the light axis. See “Xenon headl i g h t s ” ( P. 2 - 3 3 ) f o r a d d i t i o n a l information.

# HomeLink® UNIVERSAL TRANSCEIVER (if so equipped)  

The HomeLink® Universal Transceiver provides a convenient way to consolidate the functions of up to three individual hand-held transmitters into one built-in device.  

HomeLink® Universal Transceiver:  

Will operate most Radio Frequency (RF) devices such as garage doors, gates, home and office lighting, entry door locks and security systems.   
Is powered by your vehicle’s battery. No separate batteries are required. If the vehicle’s battery is discharged or is disconnected, HomeLink® will retain all programming.  

When the HomeLink® Universal Transceiver is programmed, retain the original transmitter for future programming procedures (Example: new vehicle purchases). Upon sale of the vehicle, the programmed HomeLink Universal Transceiver buttons should be erased for security purposes. For additional information, refer to “Programming HomeLink ” (P.2-60).  

# WARNING  

Do not use the HomeLink Universal Transceiver with any garage door opener that lacks safety stop and reverse features as required by federal safety standards. (These standards became effective for opener models manufactured after April 1, 1982). A garage door opener which cannot detect an object in the path of a closing garage door and then automatically stop and reverse, does not meet current federal safety standards. Using a garage door opener without these features increases the risk of serious injury or death.  

During the programming procedure your garage door or security gate will open and close (if the transmitter is within range). Make sure that people or objects are clear of the garage door, gate, etc. that you are programming.  

Your vehicle’s engine should be turned off while programming the HomeLink® Universal Transceiver. Do not breathe exhaust gases; they contain colorless and odorless carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is dangerous. It can cause unconsciousness or death.  

# PROGRAMMING HomeLink®  

If you have any questions or are having difficulty programming your HomeLink® buttons, refer to the HomeLink® web site at: www.homelink.com or call 1-800-355-3515.  

# NOTE:  

It is also recommended that a new battery be placed in the hand-held transmitter of the device being programmed to HomeLink® for quicker programming and accurate transmission of the radio-frequency.  

1. Position the end of your hand-held transmitter 1-3 in $(26-76~\mathsf{m m})$ away from the HomeLink® surface, keeping the HomeLink® indicator light $\textcircled{1}$ in view.  

![](images/18c92cb5e5d56248d7f2059ceaef9824da9bd0366eb48c655147278f6e9893e6.jpg)  

2. Using both hands, simultaneously press and hold the desired HomeLink® button and handheld transmitter button. DO NOT release until the HomeLink® indicator light $\textcircled{1}$ flashes slowly and then rapidly. When the indicator light flashes rapidly, both buttons may be released.

Some devices to be programmed may require you to replace Step 2 with the cycling procedure noted in the “Programming HomeLink® for Canadian Customers and gate openers” (P.2-61).  

![](images/f9bbcaeddfa23e03c15353b901f78c986aad50e8c2804b9578bda6baa67c146b.jpg)  

3. Press and hold the programmed HomeLink® button and observe the indicator light.  

. If the indicator light $\textcircled{1}$ is solid/continuous, programming is complete and your device should activate when the HomeLink® button is pressed and released.   
If the indicator light $\textcircled{1}$ blinks rapidly for two seconds and then turns to a solid/ continuous light, continue with Steps 4-6 for a rolling code device. A second person may make the following steps easier. Use a ladder or other device. Do not stand on your vehicle to perform the next steps.  

4. At the receiver located on the garage door opener motor in the garage, locate the “learn” or “smart” button (the name and color of the button may vary by manufacturer but it is usually located near where the hanging antenna wire is attached to the unit). If there is difficulty locating the button, reference the garage door opener’s manual.  

5. Press and release the “learn” or “smart” button.  

# NOTE:  

Once the button is pressed, you have approximately 30 seconds to initiate the next step.  

6. Return to the vehicle and firmly press and hold the programmed HomeLink® button for two seconds and release. Repeat the “press/hold/release” sequence up to 3 times to complete the programming process. HomeLink® should now activate your rolling code equipped device.  

7. If you have any questions or are having difficulty programming your HomeLink® buttons, refer to the HomeLink® web site at: www.homelink.com or call $1{\cdot}800{-}355{-}$ 3515.  

# PROGRAMMING HomeLink® FOR CANADIAN CUSTOMERS AND GATE OPENERS  

Canadian radio-frequency laws require transmitter signals to “time-out” (or quit) after several seconds of transmission – which may not be long enough for HomeLink® to pick up the signal during programming. Similar to this Canadian law, some U.S. gate operators are designed to “time-out” in the same manner.  

If you live in Canada or you are having difficulties programming a gate operator or garage door opener by using the “Programming HomeLink®” procedures, replace “Programming HomeLink®” Step 2 with the following:  

# NOTE:  

# When programming a garage door opener, etc., unplug the device during the “cycling” process to prevent possible damage to the garage door opener components.  

Step 2: Using both hands, simultaneously press and hold the desired HomeLink® button and the hand-held transmitter button. During programming, your hand-held transmitter may automatically stop transmitting. Continue to press and hold the desired HomeLink® button while you press and re-press (“cycle”) your hand-held transmitter every two seconds until the frequency signal has been learned. The HomeLink indicator light will flash slowly and then rapidly after several seconds upon successful programming. DO NOT release until the HomeLink® indicator light flashes slowly and then rapidly. When the indicator light flashes rapidly, both buttons may be released. The rapid flashing indicates successful programming.  

Proceed with “Programming HomeLink®” step 3 to complete.  

Remember to plug the device back in when programming is completed.  

# OPERATING THE HomeLink® UNIVER-SAL TRANSCEIVER  

The HomeLink® Universal Transceiver, after it is programmed, can be used to activate the programmed device. To operate, simply press and release the appropriate programmed HomeLink® Universal Transceiver button. The amber indicator light will illuminate while the signal is being transmitted.  

For convenience, the hand-held transmitter of the device may also be used at any time.  

# PROGRAMMING TROUBLESHOOTING  

If the HomeLink® does not quickly learn the hand-held transmitter information:  

replace the hand-held transmitter batteries with new batteries.   
position the hand-held transmitter with its battery area facing away from the HomeLink® surface.   
press and hold both the HomeLink® and hand-held transmitter buttons without interruption.   
position the hand-held transmitter 1-3 in $(26-76~\mathsf{m m})$ away from the HomeLink® surface. Hold the transmitter in that position for up to 15 seconds. If HomeLink® is not programmed within that time, try holding the transmitter in another position - keeping the indicator light in view at all times.  

If you have any questions or are having difficulty programming your HomeLink® buttons, refer to the HomeLink® web site at: www.homelink.com or 1-800-355-3515.  

# CLEARING THE PROGRAMMED INFORMATION

# KEYS  

A key number plate is supplied with your keys. Record the key number and keep it in a safe place (such as your wallet), not in the vehicle. If you lose your keys, see a NISSAN dealer for duplicates by using the key number. NISSAN does not record any key numbers so it is very important to keep track of your key number plate.  

A key number is only necessary when you have lost all keys and do not have one to duplicate from. If you still have a key, this key can be duplicated by a NISSAN dealer.

# VANITY MIRROR  

To use the front vanity mirror, pull down the sun visor and pull up the cover.  

The automatic drive positioner system has two features:  

. Entry/exit function Memory storage  

# ENTRY/EXIT FUNCTION  

This system is designed so that the driver’s seat will automatically move when the shift lever is in the P (Park) position. This allows the driver to get into and out of the driver’s seat more easily.  

The driver’s seat will slide backward when the driver’s door is opened with the ignition switch in the LOCK position.  

The driver’s seat will return to the previous positions when the ignition switch is pushed to the ACC position.  

The driver’s seat will not return to the previous positions if the seat adjusting switch is operated when the seat is at the exit position.  

# Cancel or activate entry/exit function  

The shift lever must be in the P (Park) position with the ignition switch in the OFF position.  

The entry/exit function can be activated or canceled by pressing and holding the SET switch for more than 10 seconds.  

The indicator lights on the memory switches (1 and 2) will blink once when the function is canceled, and the indicator lights will blink twice when the function is activated. Note that the indicator lights may illuminate after 5 seconds while holding the SET switch. This indicates readiness for linking the Intelligent Key to a stored memory position. Keep the SET switch pressed for more than 10 seconds to turn on or off the entry/exit function.  

The entry/exit function can also be activated or canceled if the “Slide Driver Seat Back on Exit” key is turned to ON or OFF in the “Comfort” settings. (See “Vehicle information and settings (models with center multi-function control panel)” (P.4-9).)  

# Initialize entry/exit function  

If the battery cable is disconnected, or if the fuse opens, the entry/exit function will not work though this function was set on before. In such a case, after connecting the battery or replacing with a new fuse, open and close the driver’s door more than two times after the ignition switch is placed in the LOCK position from the ON position. The entry/exit function will be activated.  

![](images/83c2dd82eb1986aeb53fa76b9467d5af597667242aa6fa34b09b005d6048c4ac.jpg)  

# MEMORY STORAGE  

Two positions for the driver’s seat and outside mirrors can be stored in the automatic drive positioner memory. Follow this procedure to use the memory system.  

1. Move the shift lever to the P (Park) position.   
2. Adjust the driver’s seat and outside mirrors to the desired positions by manually operating each adjusting switch. For additional information, see “Seats” (P.1-2) and “Outside mirrors” (P.3-35).   
3. Push the SET switch and, within 5 seconds, push the memory switch (1 or 2). The indicator light for the pushed memory  

switch will stay on for approximately 5 seconds after pushing the switch. When the memory is stored in the memory switch (1 or 2), a buzzer will sound. If memory is stored in the same memory switch, the previous memory will be deleted.  

Linking Intelligent Key to a stored memory position  

The Intelligent Key can be linked to a stored memory position with the following procedure.  

1. Follow one of the steps for storing a memory position. While the indicator light for the memory switch being set is illuminated for 5 seconds, push the button on the Intelligent Key. Push the ignition switch to the OFF position, and then push the SET switch. Push the button while pushing the memory button while the indicator light stays on for approximately 5 seconds.  

If the indicator light blinks, the Intelligent Key is linked to that memory setting.  

Push the ignition switch to the OFF position, and then push the button on the Intelligent Key. The driver’s seat and outside mirrors will move to the memorized position.  

# Confirming memory storage  

Push the ignition switch to the ON position and push the SET switch. If the main memory has not been stored, the indicator light will come on for approximately 0.5 second. When the memory has stored in position, the indicator light will stay on for approximately 5 seconds.   
If the battery cable is disconnected, or if the fuse opens, the memory will be canceled. In this case, reset the desired position using the previous procedure.   
If optional keys are added to your vehicle, the memory storage procedure to switch 1 or 2 and linking Intelligent Key procedure to a stored memory position should be performed again for each Intelligent Key. For additional Intelligent Key information, see “Keys” (P.3-3).  

Selecting the GUmID-e66m87o41ri94z-e88d1E -4pA2o2s-9i6tFiFo-EnE  

1. Move the shift lever to the P (Park) position.   
2. Use one of the following methods to move the driver’s seat and outside mirrors. . Push the memory switch (1 or 2). . Within 45 seconds of opening the driver’s door, push the memory switch (1 or 2).  

The driver’s seat and outside mirrors will move to the memorized position with the indicator light flashing, and then the light will stay on for approximately 5 seconds.  

# SYSTEM OPERATION  

The automatic drive positioner system will not work or will stop operating under the following conditions:  

. When the vehicle speed is above 4 MPH (7 km/h) (entry/exit function). When the vehicle is driven (memory storage). When the adjusting switch for the driver’s seat is turned on while the automatic drive positioner is operating. When the driver’s seat and outside mirrors have already been moved to the memorized position. When no position is stored in the memory switch. When the engine is started while moving the automatic drive positioner. When the shift lever is moved from the P (Park) position to any other position. (However, it will not be canceled while the driver’s seat is returning to the previous positions (entry/exit function).) When the driver’s door remains open for more than 45 seconds and the ignition switch is not in the ON position.

# REARVIEW MONITOR (if so equipped)  

The system is designed as an aid to the driver in situations such as slot parking or parallel parking.  

When the shift lever is shifted into the R (Reverse) position, the monitor display shows the view to the rear of the vehicle.  

# WARNING  

Failure to follow the warnings and instructions for proper use of the RearView Monitor could result in serious injury or death.  

The RearView Monitor is a convenience but it is not a substitute for proper backing. Always turn and look out the windows, and check mirrors to be sure that it is safe to move before operating the vehicle. Always back up slowly.   
The system is designed as an aid to the driver in showing large stationary objects directly behind the vehicle, to help avoid damaging the vehicle.   
The system cannot completely eliminate blind spots and may not show every object. Underneath the bumper and the corner areas of the bumper cannot be viewed on the RearView Monitor because of its monitoring range limitation. The system will not show small objects below the bumper, and may not show objects close to the bumper or on the ground.   
Objects viewed in the RearView Monitor differ from actual distance because a wide-angle lens is used. Objects in the RearView Monitor will appear visually opposite than when viewed in the rear view and outside mirrors.   
Make sure that the hatch, lift gate is securely closed when backing up. Do not put anything on the rear view camera. The rear view camera is installed above the license plate. When washing the vehicle with high-pressure water, be sure not to spray it around the camera. Otherwise, water may enter the camera unit causing water condensation on the lens, a malfunction, fire or an electric shock.  

Do not strike the camera. It is a precision instrument. Otherwise, it may malfunction or cause damage resulting in a fire or an electric shock.  

# ！ CAUTION  

Do not scratch the camera lens when cleaning dirt or snow from the lens.

# HOW TO READ THE DISPLAYED LINES  

Guiding lines which indicate the vehicle width and distances to objects with reference to the vehicle body line $\textcircled{4}$ are displayed on the monitor.  

# Distance guide lines:  

Indicate distances from the vehicle body.  

. Red line $\textcircled{1}$ : approx. 1.5 ft $\left(0.5~\mathsf{m}\right)$ $\bullet$ Yellow line $\textcircled{2}$ : approx. 3 ft $(1\textrm{m})$ . Green line $\textcircled{3}$ : approx. 7 ft $(2\mathfrak{m})$ . Green line $\textcircled{4}$ : approx. 10 ft $(3~\mathsf{m})$  

# Vehicle width guide lines $\textcircled{5}$ :  

Indicate the vehicle width when backing up.  

# Predictive course lines $\textcircled{6}$ (models with center multi-function control panel):  

Indicate the predictive course when backing up. The predictive course lines will be displayed on the monitor when the shift lever is in the R (Reverse) position and the steering wheel is turned. The predictive course lines will move depending on how much the steering wheel is turned and will not be displayed while the steering wheel is in the neutral position.  

The vehicle width and predictive course lines are wider than the actual width and course.  

# WARNING  

Always turn and check that it is safe to do so before backing up. Always back up slowly.   
If the tires are replaced with different sized tires, the predictive course line may be displayed incorrectly. On a snow-covered or slippery road, there may be a difference between the predictive course line and the actual course line.   
The displayed lines will appear slightly off to the right because the rear view camera is not installed in  

the rear center of the vehicle.  

The distance guide line and the vehicle width line should be used as a reference only when the vehicle is on a level paved surface. The distance viewed on the monitor is for reference only and may be different from the actual distance between the vehicle and displayed objects. When backing-up the vehicle up a hill objects viewed in the monitor are further than they appear. When backing-up the vehicle down a hill, objects viewed in the monitor are closer than they appear. Use the inside mirror or glance over your shoulder to properly judge distances to other objects.

HOW TO PARK WITH PREDICTIVE COURSE LINES (models with center multi-function control panel)  

1. Visually check that the parking space is safe before parking your vehicle.  

2. The rear view of the vehicle is displayed on the screen $\textcircled{4}$ when the shift lever is moved to the R (Reverse) position.  

![](images/85e47a47040582a0da6017b6767954d2a848a0bd0a13a172a2380adeea9f322a.jpg)  

3. Slowly back up the vehicle adjusting the steering wheel so that the predictive course lines $\textcircled{8}$ enter the parking space $\textcircled{9}$ .  

4. When the rear of the vehicle enter the parking space $\textcircled{9}$ , maneuver the steering wheel to make the vehicle width guide lines $\textcircled{0}$ parallel to the parking space $\textcircled{9}$ .  

5. When the vehicle is parked in the space completely, move the shift lever to the P (Park) position and apply the parking brake.

# DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PREDICTIVE AND ACTUAL DISTANCES (if so equipped)  

Backing up on a steep uphill  

When backing up the vehicle up a hill, the distance guide lines and the vehicle width guide lines are shown closer than the actual distance. For example, the display shows 3 ft $(1\mathrm{~m})$ to the place $\textcircled{4}$ , but the actual 3 ft $(1\mathrm{~m})$ distance on the hill is the place $\textcircled{8}$ . Note that any object on the hill is viewed in the monitor further than it appears.

# AROUND VIE $\mathbf{\nabla}\mathbf{W}^{\mathcal{\mathrm{\textregistered}}}$ MONITOR (if so equipped)  

With the ignition switch in the ON position, press the CAMERA button on the center multifunction control panel or move the shift lever to the “R” (Reverse) position to operate the Around View Monitor. The monitor displays various views of the position of the vehicle.  

# Available views:  

Bird’s-Eye View   
The surrounding view of the vehicle.   
Front-side View   
The view around and ahead of the front passenger’s side wheel.   
Front View   
The view to the front of the vehicle.   
Rear View   
The view to the rear of the vehicle.  

The system is designed as an aid to the driver in situations such as slot parking or parallel parking.  

![](images/33eb4d1e226febd2a3b8ab7eadec67cf375436625d250e23fa5eaa29fb559438.jpg)  

There are some areas where the system will not show objects and the system does not warn of moving objects. When in the front or the rear view display, an object below the bumper or on the ground may not be viewed $\textcircled{1}$ . When in the bird’s-eye view, a tall object near the seam $\textcircled{3}$ of the camera viewing areas will not appear in  

the monitor $\textcircled{2}$  

# WARNING  

The Around View Monitor is a convenience but it is not a substitute for proper vehicle operation because it has areas where objects cannot be viewed. The four corners of the vehicle in particular, are blind spots where objects do not appear in the bird’s-eye, front, or rear views. Always look out the windows and check with your own eyes to be sure that it is safe to move before operating the vehicle. Always operate the vehicle slowly.   
The driver is always responsible for safety during parking and other maneuvers.   
Do not use the Around View Monitor with the outside mirror in the stored position, and make sure that the lift gate is securely closed when operating the vehicle using the Around View Monitor.   
The distance between objects viewed on the Around View Monitor differs from the actual distance. The cameras are installed above the front grille, the outside mirrors and above the rear license plate. Do not put anything on the cameras.   
When washing the vehicle with highpressure water, be sure not to spray it around the cameras. Otherwise, water may enter the camera unit causing water condensation on the lens, a malfunction, fire or an electric shock.   
Do not strike the cameras. They are precision instruments. Doing so could cause a malfunction or cause damage resulting in a fire or an electric shock.  

# ！ CAUTION  

Do not scratch the lens when cleaning dirt or snow from the front of the camera.  

# AVAILABLE VIEWS  

# WARNING  

The distance guide line and the vehicle width line should be used as a reference only when the vehicle is on a paved, level surface. The distance viewed on the monitor is for reference only and may be different than the actual distance between the vehicle and displayed objects.   
Use the displayed lines and the bird’s-eye view as a reference. The lines and the bird’s-eye view are greatly affected by the number of occupants, fuel level, vehicle position, road condition and road grade. If the tires are replaced with different sized tires, the predictive course line and the bird’s-eye view may be displayed incorrectly.   
When driving the vehicle up a hill, objects viewed in the monitor are further than they appear. When driving the vehicle down a hill, objects viewed in the monitor are closer than they appear. Use the  

# mirrors or actually look to properly judge distances to other objects.  

The vehicle width and predictive course lines are wider than the actual width and course.  

![](images/3f99b3ae685181cda358a0442f50d7296f8327c3612fc3549dc02667f63d2cec.jpg)  
Rear view  

# Front and rear view  

Guiding lines, which indicate the vehicle width and distances to objects with reference to the vehicle body line $\textcircled{4}$ , are displayed on the monitor.  

# Distance guide lines:  

Indicate distances from the vehicle body.  

. Red line $\textcircled{1}$ : approx. 1.5 ft $\left(0.5~\mathrm{m}\right)$ . Yellow line $\textcircled{2}$ : approx. 3 ft $(1\mathrm{~m})$ . Green line $\textcircled{3}$ : approx. 7 ft $(2\mathrm{~m})$ . Green line $\textcircled{4}$ : approx. 10 ft $(3~\mathsf{m})$  

# Vehicle width guide lines $\textcircled{5}$ :  

Indicate the vehicle width when backing up.  

# Predictive course lines $\textcircled{6}$ :  

Indicate the predictive course when operating the vehicle. The predictive course lines will be displayed on the monitor when the steering wheel is turned. The predictive course lines will move depending on how much the steering wheel is turned and will not be displayed while the steering wheel is in the straight ahead position.  

The front view will not be displayed when the vehicle speed is above 6 MPH $(10~\mathsf{k m/h})$ .  

# WARNING  

The distance between objects viewed in the rear view may differ from the actual distance. Objects in the rear view will appear visually opposite from those viewed in the inside and outside mirrors.   
On a snow-covered or slippery road, there may be a difference between the predictive course line and the actual course line.   
The displayed lines on the rear view will appear slightly off to the right because the rear view camera is not installed in the rear center of the vehicle.   
The vehicle width and predictive course lines are wider than the actual width and course.  

# NOTE:  

When the monitor displays the front view and the steering wheel turns about 90 degrees or less from the neutral position, both the right and left predictive course lines $\textcircled{6}$ are displayed. When the steering wheel turns about 90 degrees or more, the predictive course line is displayed only on the opposite side of the turn.  

![](images/eea84d9384a58441ca824112aad81de7a67cedc1a45f50014a3a92085f8a1e6f.jpg)  

# Bird’s-eye view  

The bird’s-eye view shows the overhead view of the vehicle which helps confirm the vehicle position and the predicted course to a parking space.  

The vehicle icon $\textcircled{1}$ shows the position of the vehicle. Note that the distance between objects viewed in the bird’s-eye view differs from the actual distance.  

The areas that the cameras cannot cover $\textcircled{2}$ are indicated in black.  

After the ignition switch is turned on, the nonviewable area $\textcircled{2}$ is highlighted in yellow for 3 seconds after the bird’s-eye view is  

displayed.  

In addition, the non-viewable corners are displayed in red (blink for the first 3 seconds) $\textcircled{3}$ to remind the drivers to be cautious.  

# WARNING  

Objects in the bird’s-eye view will appear further than the actual distance because the bird’s-eye view is a pseudo view that is processed by combining the views from the cameras on the outside mirrors, the front and the rear of the vehicle. Tall objects, such as a curb or vehicle, may be misaligned or not displayed at the seam of the views. Objects that are above the camera cannot be displayed.   
The view for the bird’s-eye view may be misaligned when the camera position alters.   
A line on the ground may be misaligned and is not seen as being straight at the seam of the views. The misalignment will increase as the line proceeds away from the vehicle.  

Use the displayed lines and the bird’s-eye view as a reference. The lines and the bird’seye view are greatly affected by the number of occupants, fuel level, vehicle position, road condition and road grade.

# DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PREDICTIVE AND ACTUAL DISTANCES  

Backing up on a steep uphil When backing up the vehicle up a hill, the distance guide lines and the vehicle width guide lines are shown closer than the actual distance. For example, the display shows 3 ft $(1\mathrm{~m})$ to the place $\textcircled{4}$ , but the actual 3 ft $(1\mathrm{~m})$ distance on the hill is the place $\textcircled{8}$ . Note that any object on the hill is viewed in the monitor further than it appears.  

![](images/63e2a41eeed91ebb429db01b858a771066d02997550aa1614475632aa71cc46e.jpg)  

# Backing up on a steep downhill  

When backing up the vehicle down a hill, the distance guide lines and the vehicle width guide lines are shown further than the actual distance. For example, the display shows 3 ft $(1\mathrm{~m})$ to the place $\textcircled{4}$ , but the actual 3 ft $(1\mathrm{~m})$ distance on the hill is the place $\textcircled{8}$ . Note that any object on the hill is viewed in the monitor closer than it appears.

# MOVING OBJECT DETECTION (MOD) FUNCTION  

The Moving Object Detection (MOD) system can inform the driver of moving objects when driving out of garages, maneuvering into parking lots and in other such instances.  

The MOD system detects moving objects by using image processing technology on the image shown in the display.  

The MOD system operates in the following conditions when the camera view is displayed:  

When the shift lever is in the “P” or “N” position and the vehicle is stopped, the MOD system detects the moving objects in the bird’s-eye view. The MOD system will not operate if the outside mirror is moving in or out or if either door is opened. When the shift lever is in the “D” position and the vehicle speed is below approximately 5 MPH $(8\mathrm{km/h)}$ , the MOD system detects moving objects in the front view. When the shift lever is in the “R” position and the vehicle speed is below approximately 5 MPH $(8k m/h)$ , the MOD system detects moving objects in the rear view. The MOD system will not operate if the lift gate is open.  

The MOD system does not detect moving objects in the front-side view. The MOD icon is not displayed on the screen when in this view.  

# WARNING  

The MOD system is not a substitute for proper vehicle operation and does not prevent contact with the objects surrounding the vehicle. When maneuvering, always use the outside mirror and inside rearview mirror and turn and look to check the surroundings to make sure it is safe to maneuver.   
The system is not designed to prevent contact with all objects.   
The MOD system is not designed to detect surrounding stationary objects.

bird’s-eye view   
front view / rear view  

When the MOD system detects a moving object surrounding the vehicle, the yellow frame will be displayed on the view where the objects are detected and a chime will sound once. While the MOD system continues to detect moving objects, the yellow frame continues to be displayed.  

In the bird’s-eye view, the yellow frame $\textcircled{1}$ is displayed on each camera image (front, rear, right, left) depending on where moving objects are detected.  

The yellow frame $\textcircled{2}$ is displayed on each view in the front view and rear view modes.  

A blue MOD icon is displayed in the view where the MOD system is operative. A gray MOD icon is displayed in the view where the MOD system is not operative.  

If the MOD system is turned off, the MOD icon $\textcircled{3}$ is not displayed.  

The MOD system will turn on automatically under the following conditions:  

When the shift lever is in the “R” (Reverse) position.   
When the CAMERA button is pushed to switch from a different screen to the camera view on the display.   
When vehicle speed decreases below approximately 5 MPH (8 km/h).  

When the ignition switch is placed in the OFF position and then back to the ON position.  

# WARNING  

. Do not use the MOD system when towing a trailer. The system may not function properly. Excessive noise (for example, audio system volume or open vehicle window) will interfere with the chime sound, and it may not be heard. The MOD system performance will be limited according to environmental conditions and surrounding objects such as: — When there is low contrast between background and the moving objects — When there is blinking source of light. — When strong light such as another vehicle’s headlight or sunlight is present.  

— When there is dirt, water drops or snow on the camera lens. — When the position of the moving objects in the display is not changed.  

The MOD system might detect flowing water droplets on the camera lens, white smoke from the muffler, moving shadows, etc.   
The MOD system may not function properly depending on the speed, direction, distance or shape of the moving objects.   
If your vehicle sustains damage to the parts where the camera is installed, leaving it misaligned or bent, the sensing zone may be altered and the MOD system may not detect objects properly.   
When the temperature is extremely high or low, the screen may not display objects clearly. This is not a malfunction. Camera maintenance   
If dirt, rain or snow accumulates on the camera, the MOD system may not operate properly. Clean the camera.

# SERVICING AIR CONDITIONER IN-CABIN MICROFILTER  

# WARNING  

The air conditioner contains refrigerant under high pressure. To avoid personal injury, any air conditioner service should be done only by an experienced technician with the proper equipment.  

The air conditioner system in your vehicle is charged with a refrigerant designed with the environment in mind.  

This refrigerant will not harm the earth’s ozone layer. However, it may contribute in a small part to global warming.  

Special charging equipment and lubricant are required when servicing your vehicle’s air conditioner. Using improper refrigerants or lubricants will cause severe damage to the air conditioner system. (See “Air conditioning system refrigerant and lubricant recommendations” (P.9-6).)  

A NISSAN dealer will be able to service your environmentally friendly air conditioner system.  

The climate control system is equipped with an in-cabin microfilter which collects dirt, pollen, dust, etc. To make sure the air conditioner heats, defogs, and ventilates efficiently, replace the filter in accordance with the maintenance schedule in the NISSAN Service and Maintenance Guide. To replace the filter, contact a NISSAN dealer. A natural grape seed polyphenol filter (if so equipped) collects and neutralizes dirt, pollen, dust, etc.  

The filter should be replaced if air flow is extremely decreased or when windows fog up easily when operating heater or air conditioning system.  

# AUDIO SYSTEM  

# AUDIO OPERATION PRECAUTIONS  

# Radio  

Push the ignition switch to the ACC or ON position and push the radio band select button to turn on the radio. If you listen to the radio with the engine not running, the ignition switch should be pushed to the ACC position.  

Radio reception is affected by station signal strength, distance from radio transmitter, buildings, bridges, mountains and other external influences. Intermittent changes in reception quality normally are caused by these external influences.  

# Using a cellular phone in or near the vehicle may influence radio reception quality.  

# Radio reception:  

Your NISSAN radio system is equipped with state-of-the-art electronic circuits to enhance radio reception. These circuits are designed to extend reception range, and to enhance the quality of that reception.  

However there are some general characteristics of both FM and AM radio signals that can affect radio reception quality in a moving vehicle, even when the finest equipment is used. These characteristics are completely normal in a given reception area, and do not indicate any malfunction in your NISSAN radio system.  

Reception conditions will constantly change because of vehicle movement. Buildings, terrain, signal distance and interference from other vehicles can work against ideal reception. Described below are some of the factors that can affect your radio reception.  

Some cellular phones or other devices may cause interference or a buzzing noise to come from the audio system speakers. Storing the device in a different location may reduce or eliminate the noise.  

![](images/81635cd5e528e5bf99d265194f412c0b7a958414db17119f5138f677dcb54e69.jpg)  

# FM radio reception:  

Range: FM range is normally limited to 25 to 30 miles (40 to $48~\ k m)$ , with monaural (single channel) FM having slightly more range than stereo FM. External influences may sometimes interfere with FM station reception even if the FM station is within 25 miles $(40~\ k m)$ . The strength of the FM signal is directly related to the distance between the transmitter and receiver. FM signals follow a line-of-sight path, exhibiting many of the same characteristics as light. For example they will reflect off objects.  

Fade and drift: As your vehicle moves away from a station transmitter, the signals will tend to fade and/or drift.  

Static and flutter: During signal interference from buildings, large hills or due to antenna position, usually in conjunction with increased distance from the station transmitter, static or flutter can be heard. This can be reduced by lowering the treble setting to reduce the treble response.  

Multipath reception: Because of the reflective characteristics of FM signals, direct and reflected signals reach the receiver at the same time. The signals may cancel each other, resulting in momentary flutter or loss of sound.  

# AM radio reception:  

AM signals, because of their low frequency, can bend around objects and skip along the ground. In addition, the signals can be bounced off the ionosphere and bent back to earth. Because of these characteristics. AM signals are also subject to interference as they travel from transmitter to receiver.  

Fading: Occurs while the vehicle is passing through freeway underpasses or in areas with many tall buildings. It can also occur for several seconds during ionospheric turbulence even in areas where no obstacles exist.  

Static: Caused by thunderstorms, electrical power lines, electric signs and even traffic lights.  

# Satellite radio GrUIeD-cDe73pAt3i9oBFn-4 3(Ci8f- 4s59oF- 9eC2q4-u4i7Bp7pF5e79dC)4:0  

When the satellite radio is used for the first time or the battery has been replaced, the satellite radio may not work properly. This is not a malfunction. Wait more than 10 minutes with the satellite radio ON and the vehicle outside of any metal or large building for the satellite radio to receive all of the necessary data.  

The satellite radio mode requires an active SiriusXM Satellite Radio subscription. The satellite radio is not available in Alaska, Hawaii and Guam.  

The satellite radio performance may be affected if cargo carried on the roof blocks the satellite radio signal.  

If possible, do not put cargo near the satellite antenna.  

A build up of ice on the satellite radio antenna can affect satellite radio performance. Remove the ice to restore satellite radio reception.

# Compressed Audio Files (MP3/WMA/ AAC)  

# Explanation of terms:  

MP3 — MP3 is short for Moving Pictures Experts Group Audio Layer 3. MP3 is the most well known compressed digital audio file format. This format allows for near “CD quality” sound, but at a fraction of the size of normal audio files. MP3 conversion of an audio track can reduce the file size by approximately a 10:1 ratio (Sampling: 44.1 kHz, Bit rate: 128 kbps) with virtually no perceptible loss in quality. The compression reduces certain parts of sound that seem inaudible to most people.  

WMA — Windows Media Audio (WMA) is a compressed audio format created by Microsoft as an alternative to MP3. The WMA codec offers greater file compression than the MP3 codec, enabling storage of more digital audio tracks in the same amount of space when compared to MP3s at the same level of quality.   
AAC/M4A (if so equipped) — Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is a lossy audio compression format. Audio files that have been encoded with AAC are generally smaller in size and deliver a higher quality of sound than MP3.   
Bit rate — Bit rate denotes the number of bits per second used by a digital music file. The size and quality of a compressed digital audio file is determined by the bit rate used when encoding the file.   
Sampling frequency — Sampling frequency is the rate at which the samples of a signal are converted from analog to digital (A/D conversion) per second.   
Multisession — Multisession is one of the methods for writing data to media. Writing data once to the media is called a single session, and writing more than once is called a multisession.  

ID3/WMA Tag — The ID3/WMA tag is the part of the encoded MP3 or WMA file that contains information about the digital music file such as song title, artist, album title, encoding bit rate, track time duration, etc. ID3 tag information is displayed on the Album/Artist/Track title line on the display.

# Playback order:  

The folder names of folders not containing compressed audio files are not shown in the display.   
If there is a file in the top level of a disc/USB, “Root Folder” is displayed.  

The playback order is the order in which the files were written by the writing software, so the files might not play in the desired order. Music playback order of compressed audio files is as illustrated.

# Bluetooth® STREAMING AUDIO (models with navigation system)  

Your NISSAN is equipped with Bluetooth® Streaming Audio. If you have a compatible Bluetooth® device with streaming audio (A2DP profile), you can set up the wireless connection between your Bluetooth® device and the invehicle audio system. This connection allows you to listen to the audio from the Bluetooth® device using your vehicle speakers. It also may allow basic control of the device for playing and skipping audio files using the AVRCP Bluetooth® profile. All Bluetooth® Devices do not have the same level of controls for AVRCP. Please consult the manual for your Bluetooth® Device for more details.  

Once your Bluetooth device is connected to the in-vehicle audio system, it will automatically reconnect whenever the device is present in the vehicle and you select Bluetooth Audio from your audio system. You do not need to manually reconnect for each usage.  

Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) and the Bluetooth® functions share the same frequency band (2.4 GHz). Using the Bluetooth® and the wireless LAN functions at the same time may slow down or disconnect the communication and cause undesired noise. It is recommended that you turn off the wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) when using the  

Bluetooth® functions.

# Bluetooth® HANDS-FREE PHONE SYSTEM (Type A) (if so equipped)  

\*Type A is models with navigation system.  

# WARNING  

Use a phone after stopping your vehicle in a safe location. If you have to use a phone while driving, exercise extreme caution at all times so full attention may be given to vehicle operation. If you find yourself unable to devote full attention to vehicle operation while talking on the phone, pull off the road to a safe location and stop your vehicle before doing so.  

# CAUTION  

To avoid draining the vehicle battery, use a phone after starting the engine.  

Your NISSAN is equipped with Bluetooth® Hands-Free Phone System. If you are an owner of a compatible Bluetooth® enabled cellular phone, you can set up the wireless connection between your cellular phone and the in-vehicle phone module. With Bluetooth® wireless technology, you can make or receive a telephone call with your cellular phone in your pocket.  

Once a cellular phone is connected to the invehicle phone module, no phone connecting procedure is required anymore. Your phone is automatically connected with the in-vehicle phone module when the ignition switch is pushed to the ON position with the registered cellular phone turned on and carried in the vehicle.  

You can register up to 5 different Bluetooth® cellular phones in the in-vehicle phone module. However, you can talk on only one cellular phone at a time.  

The NISSAN Voice Recognition system supports the phone commands, so dialing a phone number using your voice is possible. For more details, see “NISSAN voice recognition system (models with navigation system)” (P.4-148).  

Before using the Bluetooth® Hands-Free Phone System, refer to the following notes.  

Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) and the Bluetooth® functions share the same frequency band (2.4 GHz). Using the Bluetooth® and the wireless LAN functions at the same time may slow down or disconnect the communication and cause undesired noise. It is recommended that you turn off the wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) when using the Bluetooth® functions.  

Set up the wireless connection between a   
compatible cellular phone and the in-vehicle   
phone module before using the Bluetooth®   
Hands-Free Phone System.   
Some Bluetooth® enabled cellular phones   
may not be recognized by the in-vehicle   
phone module. Please visit   
www.nissanusa.com/bluetooth for a recom  
mended phone list.   
You will not be able to use a hands-free   
phone under the following conditions:   
— Your vehicle is outside of the telephone service area.   
— Your vehicle is in an area where it is difficult to receive radio waves; such as in a tunnel, in an underground parking garage, behind a tall building or in a mountainous area.   
— Your cellular phone is locked in order not to be dialed.   
When the radio wave reception is not good   
or ambient sound is too loud, it may be   
difficult to hear the other person’s voice   
during a call.   
Immediately after the ignition switch is  

pushed to the ON position, it may be impossible to receive a call for a short period of time.  

. Do not place the cellular phone in an area surrounded by metal or far away from the invehicle phone module to prevent tone quality degradation and wireless connection disruption. While a cellular phone is connected through the Bluetooth® wireless connection, the battery power of the cellular phone may discharge quicker than usual. If the Bluetooth® Hands-Free Phone System seems to be malfunctioning, please visit www.nissanusa.com/bluetooth for troubleshooting help. Some cellular phones or other devices may cause interference or a buzzing noise to come from the audio system speakers. Storing the device in a different location may reduce or eliminate the noise. Refer to the cellular phone Owner’s Manual regarding the telephone pairing procedure specific to your phone, battery charging, cellular phone antenna, etc. The antenna display on the monitor will not coincide with the antenna display of some cellular phones. Keep the interior of the vehicle as quiet as possible to hear the caller’s voice clearly as well as to minimize its echoes.  

If reception between callers is unclear, adjusting the incoming or outgoing call volume may improve the clarity.

# Bluetooth  

Bluetooth® is a trademark owned by Bluetooth SIG, Inc., and licensed to Visteon Corporation.  

# USING THE SYSTEM  

The NISSAN Voice Recognition system allows hands-free operation of the Bluetooth® HandsFree Phone System.  

If the vehicle is in motion, some commands may not be available so full attention may be given to vehicle operation.  

# Initialization  

When the ignition switch is pushed to the ON position, NISSAN Voice Recognition is initialized, which may take up to one minute. If the $\pmb{\cdot}$ button is pushed before the initialization completes, the system will accept any command.  

# Operating tipGsU  

To get the best performance out of the NISSAN Voice Recognition system, observe the following:  

Keep the interior of the vehicle as quiet as possible. Close the windows to eliminate surrounding noises (traffic noises, vibration sounds, etc.), which may prevent the system from recognizing voice commands correctly.  

Wait until the tone sounds before speaking a command. Otherwise, the command will not be received properly.   
Start speaking a command within 5 seconds after the tone sounds.   
Speak in a natural voice without pausing between words.  

# Giving voice command  

To operate NISSAN Voice Recognition, push and release the $\therefore c$ button located on the steering wheel. After the tone sounds, speak a command.  

The command given is picked up by the microphone, and voice feedback is given when the command is accepted.  

If you need to hear the available commands for the current menu again, say “Help” and the system will repeat them.   
If a command is not recognized, the system announces, “Command not recognized. Please say again.” Repeat the command in a clear voice.   
If you want to go back to the previous command, you can say “Go back” or “Correction” anytime the system is waiting for a response.   
You can cancel a command when the system is waiting for a response by saying,  

“Cancel” or “Quit.” The system announces “Cancel” and ends the VR session. You can also push and hold the button for 5 seconds on the steering wheel at any time to cancel the VR session. Whenever the VR session is cancelled, a double beep is played to indicate you have exited the system.  

# Voice prompt inturrpt:  

In most cases you can interrupt the voice feedback to speak the next command by pressing the $\therefore c$ button on the steering wheel.  

# One Shot Call:  

To use the system faster, you may speak the second level commands with the main menu command on the main menu. For example, press the $\therefore c$ button and after the tone say, “Call Redial.” Note: The combined command of Call and (Speak Name) cannot be used.  

# How to say numbers  

NISSAN Voice Recognition requires a certain way to speak numbers in voice commands. Refer to the rules and examples below.  

Either “zero” or “oh” can be used for $"0"$ .   
Example: 1-800-662-6200   
— “One eight oh oh six six two six two oh oh”, or  

— “One eight zero zero six six two six two oh oh”  

Words can be used for the first 4 digits   
places only.   
Example: 1-800-662-6200   
— “One eight hundred six six two six two oh oh”,   
— NOT “One eight hundred six six two sixty two hundred, and   
— NOT “One eight oh oh six six two sixty two hundred.  

Numbers can be spoken in small groups. The system will prompt you to continuing entering digits, if desired.  

Example: 1-800-662-6200  

— “One eight zero zero” The system repeats the numbers and prompts you to enter more.   
“six six two” The system repeats the numbers and prompts you to enter more.   
“six two zero zero”  

You can say “Star” for “\*” and “Pound” for “#” at any time in any position of the phone number. (Available only when using the “Special Number” command.) Example: 1-555-1212 \*123  

— “One five five five one two one two star one two three”

# Bluetooth® HANDS-FREE PHONE SYSTEM (Type C) (if so equipped)  

\* Type C is models without navigation system/with text message function.  

# WARNING  

Use a phone after stopping your vehicle in a safe location. If you have to use a phone while driving, exercise extreme caution at all times so full attention may be given to vehicle operation.   
If you are unable to devote full attention to vehicle operation while talking on the phone, pull off the road to a safe location and stop your vehicle.  

# ! CAUTION  

# To avoid draining the vehicle battery, use a phone after starting the engine.  

Your NISSAN is equipped with the Bluetooth® Hands-Free Phone System. If you have a compatible Bluetooth® enabled cellular phone, you can set up the wireless connection between your cellular phone and the in-vehicle phone module. With Bluetooth® wireless technology, you can make or receive a hands-free telephone call with your cellular phone in the vehicle.  

Once your cellular phone is connected to the invehicle phone module, no other phone connecting procedure is required. Your phone is automatically connected with the in-vehicle phone module when the ignition switch is placed in the ACC or ON position with the previously connected cellular phone turned on and carried in the vehicle.  

# NOTE:  

Some devices require the user to accept connections to other Bluetooth devices. If your phone does not connect automatic ally to the system, consult the phone’s Owner’s Manual for details on device operation.  

You can connect up to 5 different Bluetooth cellular phones to the in-vehicle phone module. However, you can talk on only one cellular phone at a time.  

Before using the Bluetooth® Hands-Free Phone System, refer to the following notes.

You will not be able to use a hands-free phone under the following conditions: — Your vehicle is outside of the cellular service area. — Your vehicle is in an area where it is difficult to receive a cellular signal; such as in a tunnel, in an underground parking garage, near a tall building or in a mountainous area. When the radio wave condition is not ideal or ambient sound is too loud, it may be difficult to hear the other person’s voice during a call.   
. Do not place the cellular phone in an area surrounded by metal or far away from the invehicle phone module to prevent tone quality degradation and wireless connection disruption. While a cellular phone is connected through the Bluetooth® wireless connection, the battery power of the cellular phone may discharge quicker than usual. The Bluetooth® Hands-Free Phone System cannot charge cellular phones.  

If the hands-free phone system seems to be malfunctioning, see “Troubleshooting guide” in this section. You can also visit www. nissanusa.com/bluetooth for troubleshooting help. Some cellular phones or other devices may cause interference or a buzzing noise to come from the audio system speakers. Storing the device in a different location may reduce or eliminate the noise. Refer to the cellular phone Owner’s Manual regarding the telephone charges, cellular phone antenna and body, etc.

NISSAN Voice Recognition allows hands-free operation of the Phone, Navigation, Information and Audio systems in one of two modes, Standard Mode or Alternate Command Mode.  

In Standard Mode, commands that are available are always shown on the display and announced by the system. You can complete your desired operation by simply following the prompts given by the system. (See “NISSAN voice recognition standard mode” (P.4-148) for details.)  

For advanced operation, you can use the Alternate Command Mode. (See “NISSAN voice recognition alternate command mode” (P.4- 159) for details.) When this mode is active, an expanded list of commands can be spoken after pushing the TALK switch, and the voice command menu prompts are turned off. Review the expanded command list, which is available when this mode is active. Note that in this mode the recognition success rate may be affected as the number of available commands and the ways of speaking each command are increased.  

To switch one mode to another, see each mode description later in this section.  

To improve the recognition success rate when Alternate Command Mode is active, try using the Speaker Adaptation Function available in that mode. Otherwise, it is recommended that Alternate Command Mode be turned off and  

Standard Mode be used for the best recognition performance.  

For the voice commands for the navigation system, refer to the Navigation System Owner’s Manual of your vehicle.  

# NISSAN VOICE RECOGNITION STANDARD MODE

The interior of the vehicle should be as quiet as possible. Close the windows to eliminate the surrounding noises (traffic noise and vibration sounds, etc.), which may prevent the system from correctly recognizing the voice commands.   
Wait until the tone sounds before speaking a command.   
Speak in a natural conversational voice without pausing between words.   
If the air conditioner is set to “Auto”, the fan speed is automatically lowered so that your commands can be recognized more easily.  

![](images/0278bfcf014d99f8b1a85b8499e8c03e0d1e9a4806740e21719b8b7ef2b66d31.jpg)  

# Giving voice commands  

1. Push the TALK $\sun$ switch located on the steering wheel.   
2. A list of commands appears on the screen, and you will hear a prompt.   
3. After the tone sounds and the icon on the screen changes from to $\frac{\circ}{5000}$ , speak a command. Selecting the “Practice” key will start the practice mode. See “Let’s Practice” (P.4-   
150).   
4. Continue to follow the voice menu prompts and speak after the tone sounds until your desired operation is completed.  

Selecting the “Help” key can display the detailed information of the each command.  

# Operating tips:  

Say a command after the tone.   
Commands that are available are always shown on the display and spoken through voice menu prompts. Commands other than those that are displayed are not accepted. Please follow the prompts given by the system.   
If the command is not recognized, the system announces, “Please say again”. Repeat the command in a clear voice.   
Push the BACK button once to return to the previous screen.

# Voice Prompt Interrupt:  

To skip the voice guidance function and give the command immediately, press the TALK switch to interrupt the system. Remember to speak after the tone.  

# How to speak numbers:  

NISSAN Voice Recognition requires a certain way to speak numbers when giving voice commands. Refer to the following examples.  

# General rule  

Only single digits 0 (zero) to 9 can be used. (For example, if you would like to say 500, “five zero zero” can be used, but “five hundred” cannot.)  

# Examples  

1-800-662-6200   
— “One eight zero zero six six two six two zero zero”  

# Improving Recognition of Phone numbers  

You can improve the recognition of phone numbers by saying the phone number in three groups of numbers. For example, when you try to call 800-662-6200, say “eight zero zero” first, and the system will then ask you for the next three digits. Then, say “six six two”. After recognition, the system will then ask for the last four digits. Say, “six two zero zero”. Using this method of phone digit entry can improve recognition performance.  

When speaking a house number, speak the number $"0"$ as “zero”. If the letter $"0(\mathrm{Oh})"$ is included in the house number, it will not be recognized as the number $^{*}0$ (zero)” even if you speak “oh” instead of “zero”. Please speak “zero” for the number $\mathbf{\mathfrak{s}}_{0}$ (zero)”, “oh” for the letter “o (oh)”.  

# Send digits using dial tone:  

Press the TALK $\sun$ switch during a phone call. The menu will be launched and you will be provided with the following guidance: "Please say the digits to dial". After guidance, say the digits of the number you want to send. After this, the digits that have been recognized will be read out. If you press the ENTER button on the steering wheel or on the multi-function controller, the selected digits will be sent.

9. The system announces, “Dial or Change Number?”  

10. Speak “Dial”.  

11. The system makes a call to 800-662-6200.  

# Note:  

You can also speak “800-662-6200” (10 continuous digits) or “662-6200” (7 continuous digits), if the area code is not necessary. However, the 3-3-4 digit grouping is recommended for improved recognition. (See “How to speak numbers” earlier in this section.) You can only say a phone number using the 3-3-4 grouping, 7 digits, and 10 digits using this command. Please use the “International Call” command for all other formats. If you say “Change Number” during phone number entry, the system will automatically request that you repeat the number using the 3-3-4 format. In this case please say the area code first and then follow the prompts. Do not add a “1” in front of the area code when speaking phone numbers. If the system does not recognize your command, please try repeating the command using a natural voice. Speaking too slow or too loudly may further decrease recognition performance.

# NISSAN VOICE RECOGNITION ALTERNATE COMMAND MODE  

The following section is applicable when Alternate Command Mode is activated.  

When Alternate Command Mode is activated, an expanded list of commands can be used after pressing the TALK switch. In this mode, available commands are not fully shown on the display or prompted. Review the expanded command list when this mode is active. See examples of Alternate Command Mode screens.  

Please note that in this mode the recognition success rate may be affected as the number of available commands and ways of speaking each command are increased. To improve the recognition success rate, try using the Speaker Adaptation Function available in that mode. (See “Speaker adaptation function (for Alternate Command Mode)” (P.4-167).) Otherwise it is recommended that Alternate Command Mode be turned OFF and Standard Mode be used for the best recognition performance.

# USING THE SYSTEM  

# Initialization  

When the ignition switch is pushed to the ON position, NISSAN Voice Recognition is initialized, which may take up to one minute. When completed, the system is ready to accept voice commands. If the TALK switch is pushed before the initialization completes the display will show the message: “System not ready.” or a beep sounds.  

# Before starting  

To get the best performance from NISSAN Voice Recognition, observe the following.  

Keep the interior of the vehicle as quiet as possible. Close the windows to eliminate the surrounding noises (traffic noises, vibration sounds, etc.), which may prevent the system from recognizing the voice commands correctly.   
When the air conditioner is in the AUTO mode, the fan speed decreases automatically for easy recognition.   
Wait until a tone sounds before speaking a command.  

Speak in a natural voice without pausing between words.  

![](images/0ad38ee70f0baa1cdf8212d5e2e131bfa53943013d6196490400e57b17bb6f7b.jpg)  

# Giving voice command  

1. Push and release the TALK $\sun$ switch located on the steering wheel.   
2. A list of commands appears on the screen, and you will hear a prompt.   
3. After the tone sounds and the icon on the screen changes from to $\frac{\circ}{5000}$ , speak a command.  

# Operating tips:  

Voice commands cannot be accepted when the icon is .   
The list displayed can be scrolled by tilting the menu control switch on the steering wheel. If the command is not recognized, the system announces, “Please say again”. Repeat the command in a clear voice.   
Push the BACK button once to return to the previous screen.   
If you want to cancel the command, push and hold the TALK switch for 1 second. The message “Voice canceled” will be announced.  

# Voice Prompt Interrupt:  

To skip the voice guidance function and give the command immediately, press the TALK switch to interrupt the system. Remember to speak after the tone.  

# How to speak numbers:  

NISSAN Voice Recognition requires a certain way to speak numbers when giving voice commands. Refer to the following examples.  

# General rule  

Only single digits 0 (zero) to 9 can be used. (For example, if you would like to say 500, “five zero zero” can be used, but “five hundred” cannot.  

# Phone numbers  

Speak phone numbers according to the following examples:  

1-800-662-6200  

— “Dial one eight zero zero six six two six two zero zero.”  

Note 1: For the best voice recognition phone dialing results, say phone numbers as single digits.  

Note 2: You cannot say 555-6000 as “five five five six thousands”.  

Note 3: When speaking a house number, speak the number $"0"$ as “ zero”. If the letter $^{*}o(O\mathsf{h})^{*}$ is included in the house number, it will not be recognized as the number $^{*}0$ (zero)” even if you speak “oh” instead of “ zero”. Please speak “zero” for the number $^{*}0$ (zero)”, “oh” for the letter $"0(\mathrm{oh})"$ .  

# Send digits using dial tone:  

Press the TALK $\sun$ switch during a phone call. The menu will be launched and you will be provided with the following guidance: "Please say the digits to dial". After guidance, say the digits of the number you want to send. After this, the digits that have been recognized will be read out. If you press the ENTER button on the steering wheel or on the multi-function controller, the selected digits will be sent.

# PRECAUTIONS WHEN STARTING AND DRIVING  

# WARNING  

Do not leave children or adults who would normally require the support of others alone in your vehicle. Pets should not be left alone either. They could accidentally injure themselves or others through inadvertent operation of the vehicle. Also, on hot, sunny days, temperatures in a closed vehicle could quickly become high enough to cause severe or possibly fatal injuries to people or animals.   
Properly secure all cargo with ropes or straps to help prevent it from sliding or shifting. Do not place cargo higher than the seatbacks. In a sudden stop or collision, unsecured cargo could cause personal injury.  

# EXHAUST GAS (carbon monoxide)  

# WARNING  

. Do not breathe exhaust gases; they contain colorless and odorless carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is dangerous. It can cause unconsciousness or death. If you suspect that exhaust fumes are entering the vehicle, drive with all windows fully open, and have the vehicle inspected immediately. Do not run the engine in closed spaces such as a garage. Do not park the vehicle with the engine running for any extended length of time. Keep the lift gate closed while driving, otherwise exhaust gases could be drawn into the passenger compartment. If you must drive with the lift gate open, follow these precautions:  

1. Open all the windows.  

2. Set the $\textcircled{5}$ air recirculation to off and the fan control to high to  

circulate the air.   
If electrical wiring or other cable connections must pass to a trailer through the seal on the lift gate or the body, follow the manufacturer’s recommendation to prevent carbon monoxide entry into the vehicle.   
If a special body, camper or other equipment is added for recreational or other usage, follow the manufacturer’s recommendation to prevent carbon monoxide entry into the vehicle. (Some recreational vehicle appliances such as stoves, refrigerators, heaters, etc. may also generate carbon monoxide.)   
The exhaust system and body should be inspected by a qualified mechanic whenever:   
— The vehicle is raised for service. — You suspect that exhaust fumes are entering into the passenger compartment.   
— You notice a change in the sound of the exhaust system.   
— You have had an accident involving damage to the exhaust  

system, underbody, or rear of the vehicle.  

# THREE-WAY CATALYST  

The three-way catalyst is an emission control device installed in the exhaust system. Exhaust gases in the three-way catalyst are burned at high temperatures to help reduce pollutants.  

# WARNING  

The exhaust gas and the exhaust system are very hot. Keep people, animals or flammable materials away from the exhaust system components. Do not stop or park the vehicle over flammable materials such as dry grass, waste paper or rags. They may ignite and cause a fire.  

# CAUTION  

Do not use leaded gasoline. Deposits from leaded gasoline will seriously reduce the three-way catalyst’s ability to help reduce ex  

haust pollutants.  

Keep your engine tuned up. Malfunctions in the ignition, fuel injection, or electrical systems can cause overrich fuel flow into the three-way catalyst, causing it to overheat. Do not keep driving if the engine misfires, or if noticeable loss of performance or other unusual operating conditions are detected. Have the vehicle inspected promptly by a NISSAN dealer.   
Avoid driving with an extremely low fuel level. Running out of fuel could cause the engine to misfire, damaging the three-way catalyst.   
Do not race the engine while warming it up.   
Do not push or tow your vehicle to start the engine.  

# TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM (TPMS)  

Each tire, including the spare (if provided), should be checked monthly when cold and inflated to the inflation pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label. (If your vehicle has tires of a different size than the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label, you should determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.)  

As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) that illuminates a low tire pressure telltale when one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated. Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale illuminates, you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure. Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle’s handling and stopping ability.  

Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is the driver’s responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire  

pressure telltale.  

Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate when the system is not operating properly. The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the low tire pressure telltale. When the system detects a malfunction, the telltale will flash for approximately one minute and then remain continuously illuminated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction exists. When the malfunction indicator is illuminated, the system may not be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as intended. TPMS malfunctions may occur for a variety of reasons, including the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly. Always check the TPMS malfunction telltale after replacing one or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alternate tires and wheels allow the TPMS to continue to function properly.  

# Additional information  

The TPMS does not monitor the tire pressure of the spare tire. The TPMS will activate only when the vehicle is driven at speeds above 16 MPH $\left(25~\mathsf{k m}/\mathsf{h}\right)$ . Also, this system may not detect a sudden drop in tire pressure (for example a  

# 5-4 Starting and driving  

flat tire while driving).  

The low tire pressure warning light does not automatically turn off when the tire pressure is adjusted. After the tire is inflated to the recommended pressure, the vehicle must be driven at speeds above 16 MPH $\left(25~\mathsf{k m}/\mathsf{h}\right)$ to activate the TPMS and turn off the low tire pressure warning light. Use a tire pressure gauge to check the tire pressure.  

The CHECK TIRE PRESSURE warning also appears on the vehicle information display when the low tire pressure warning light is illuminated and low tire pressure is detected. The CHECK TIRE PRESSURE warning turns off when the low tire pressure warning light turns off.  

The CHECK TIRE PRESSURE warning appears each time the ignition switch is placed in the ON position as long as the low tire pressure warning light remains illuminated.  

The CHECK TIRE PRESSURE warning does not appear if the low tire pressure warning light illuminates to indicate a TPMS malfunction.  

Tire pressure rises and falls depending on the heat caused by the vehicle’s operation and the outside temperature. Low outside temperature can lower the temperature of the air inside the tire which can cause a lower tire inflation pressure. This may cause the low tire pressure warning light to illuminate. If the warning light illuminates in low ambient temperature, check the tire pressure for all four tires.  

For additional information, see “Low tire pressure warning light” (P.2-14) and “Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)” (P.6-3).  

# WARNING  

If the low tire pressure warning light illuminates while driving, avoid sudden steering maneuvers or abrupt braking, reduce vehicle speed, pull off the road to a safe location and stop the vehicle as soon as possible. Driving with under-inflated tires may permanently damage the tires and increase the likelihood of tire failure. Serious vehicle damage could occur and may lead to an accident and could result in serious personal injury. Check the tire pressure for all four tires. Adjust the tire pressure to the recommended COLD tire pressure shown on the Tire and Loading Information label to turn  

the low tire pressure warning light OFF. If the light still illuminates while driving after adjusting the tire pressure, a tire may be flat. If you have a flat tire, replace it with a spare tire as soon as possible. (See “Flat tire” (P.6-3) for changing a flat tire.)   
When a spare tire is mounted or a wheel is replaced, the TPMS will not function and the low tire pressure warning light will flash for approximately 1 minute. The light will remain on after 1 minute. Contact your NISSAN dealer as soon as possible for tire replacement and/ or system resetting.   
Replacing tires with those not originally specified by NISSAN could affect the proper operation of the TPMS.   
Do not inject any tire liquid or aerosol tire sealant into the tires, as this may cause a malfunction of the tire pressure sensors.  

# ! CAUTION  

The TPMS may not function properly when the wheels are equipped with tire chains or the wheels are buried in snow.   
Do not place metalized film or any metal parts (antenna, etc.) on the windows. This may cause poor reception of the signals from the tire pressure sensors, and the TPMS will not function properly.  

Some devices and transmitters may temporarily interfere with the operation of the TPMS and cause the low tire pressure warning light to illuminate. Some examples are:  

. Facilities or electric devices using similar radio frequencies are near the vehicle. If a transmitter set to similar frequencies is being used in or near the vehicle. If a computer (or similar equipment) or a DC/ AC converter is being used in or near the vehicle.

# TPMS with Easy Fill Tire Alert  

When adding air to an under-inflated tire, the TPMS with Easy Fill Tire Alert provides visual and audible signals outside the vehicle to help you inflate the tires to the recommended COLD tire pressure.  

# Vehicle set-up:  

1. Park the vehicle in a safe and level place.   
2. Apply the parking brake and place the shift lever in the P (Park) position.   
3. Place the ignition switch in the ON position. Do not start the engine.  

# Operation:  

1. Add air to the tire.   
2. Within a few seconds, the hazard indicators will start flashing.   
3. When the designated pressure is reached, the horn beeps once and the hazard indicators stop flashing.   
4. Perform the above steps for each tire. . If the tire is over-inflated to more than approximately 4 psi $(30\mathsf{k P a})$ , the horn beeps and the hazard indicators flash 3 times. To correct the pressure, push the core of the valve stem on the tire briefly to release pressure. When the pressure reaches the designated pressure, the  

horn beeps once.  

. If the hazard indicator does not flash within approximately 15 seconds after starting to inflate the tire, it indicates that the TPMS with Easy Fill Tire Alert is not operating.   
. The TPMS will not activate the Easy Fill Tire Alert under the following conditions:   
— If there is interference from an external device or transmitter   
— The air pressure from the inflation device is not sufficient to inflate the tire   
— There is a malfunction in the TPMS system   
— There is a malfunction in the horn or hazard indicators   
— The identification code of the tire pressure sensor is not registered to the system   
— The battery of the tire pressure sensor is low   
. If the TPMS with Easy Fill Tire Alert does not operate due to TPMS interference, move the vehicle about 1 m (3 ft) backward or forward and try again.  

If the TPMS with Easy Fill Tire Alert is not working, use a tire pressure gauge.  

# AVOIDING COLLISION AND ROLL-OVER  

# WARNING  

Failure to operate this vehicle in a safe and prudent manner may result in loss of control or an accident.  

Be alert and drive defensively at all times. Obey all traffic regulations. Avoid excessive speed, high speed cornering, or sudden steering maneuvers, because these driving practices could cause you to lose control of your vehicle. As with any vehicle, a loss of control could result in a collision with other vehicles or objects, or cause the vehicle to rollover, particularly if the loss of control causes the vehicle to slide sideways. Be attentive at all times, and avoid driving when tired. Never drive when under the influence of alcohol or drugs (including prescription or over-the-counter drugs which may cause drowsiness). Always wear your seat belt as outlined in the “Seat belts” (P.1-15) of this manual, and also instruct your passengers to do so.  

Seat belts help reduce the risk of injury in collisions and rollovers. In a rollover crash, an unbelted or improperly belted person is  

# significantly more likely to be injured or killed than a person properly wearing a seat belt.  

# OFF-ROAD RECOVERY  

If the right side or left side wheels leave the road surface, maintain control of the vehicle by following the procedure below. Please note that this procedure is only a general guide. The vehicle must be driven as appropriate based on the conditions of the vehicle, road and traffic.  

1. Remain calm and do not overreact.   
2. Do not apply the brakes.   
3. Maintain a firm grip on the steering wheel with both hands and try to hold a straight course.   
4. When appropriate, slowly release the accelerator pedal to gradually slow the vehicle.   
5. If there is nothing in the way, steer the vehicle to follow the road while the vehicle speed is reduced. Do not attempt to drive the vehicle back onto the road surface until vehicle speed is reduced.   
6. When it is safe to do so, gradually turn the steering wheel until both tires return to the road surface. When all tires are on the road surface, steer the vehicle to stay in the appropriate driving lane.  

. If you decide that it is not safe to return the vehicle to the road surface based on vehicle, road or traffic conditions, gradually slow the vehicle to a stop in a safe place off the road.  

# RAPID AIR PRESSURE LOSS  

Rapid air pressure loss or a “blow-out” can occur if the tire is punctured or is damaged due to hitting a curb or pothole. Rapid air pressure loss can also be caused by driving on underinflated tires.  

Rapid air pressure loss can affect the handling and stability of the vehicle, especially at highway speeds.  

Help prevent rapid air pressure loss by maintaining the correct air pressure and visually inspect the tires for wear and damage. See “Wheels and tires” (P.8-30).  

If a tire rapidly loses air pressure or “blows-out” while driving maintain control of the vehicle by following the procedure below. Please note that this procedure is only a general guide. The vehicle must be driven as appropriate based on the conditions of the vehicle, road and traffic.  

# WARNING  

The following actions can increase the chance of losing control of the vehicle if there is a sudden loss of tire air pressure. Losing control of the vehicle may cause a collision and result in personal injury.  

The vehicle generally moves or pulls in the direction of the flat tire.   
Do not rapidly apply the brakes.   
Do not rapidly release the accelerator pedal.   
Do not rapidly turn the steering wheel.   
1. Remain calm and do not overreact.   
2. Maintain a firm grip on the steering wheel with both hands and try to hold a straight course.   
3. When appropriate, slowly release the accelerator pedal to gradually slow the vehicle.   
4. Gradually steer the vehicle to a safe location off the road and away from traffic if possible.   
5. Lightly apply the brake pedal to gradually stop the vehicle.  

# PUSH-BUTTON IGNITION SWITCH  

6. Turn on the hazard warning flashers and either contact a roadside emergency service to change the tire or see “Changing a flat tire” (P.6-3).  

# DRINKING ALCOHOL/DRUGS AND DRIVING  

# WARNING  

Never drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Alcohol in the bloodstream reduces coordination, delays reaction time and impairs judgement. Driving after drinking alcohol increases the likelihood of being involved in an accident injuring yourself and others. Additionally, if you are injured in an accident, alcohol can increase the severity of the injury.  

NISSAN is committed to safe driving. However, you must choose not to drive under the influence of alcohol. Every year thousands of people are injured or killed in alcohol-related accidents. Although the local laws vary on what is considered to be legally intoxicated, the fact is that alcohol affects all people differently and most people underestimate the effects of alcohol.  

# 5-8 Starting and driving  

Remember, drinking and driving don’t mix! And that is true for drugs, too (over-the-counter, prescription, and illegal drugs). Don’t drive if your ability to operate your vehicle is impaired by alcohol, drugs, or some other physical condition.  

# WARNING  

Do not operate the push-button ignition switch while driving the vehicle except in an emergency. (The engine will stop when the ignition switch is pushed 3 consecutive times or the ignition switch is pushed and held for more than 2 seconds.) If the engine stops while the vehicle is being driven, this could lead to a crash and serious injury.  

Before operating the push-button ignition switch, be sure to move the shift lever to the P (Park) position.

. Adjust inside and outside mirrors.   
. Fasten seat belts and ask all passengers to do likewise. Check the operation of warning lights when the ignition switch is pushed to the ON position. (See “Warning/indicator lights and audible reminders” (P.2-11).)  

# STARTING THE ENGINE  

1. Apply the parking brake.  

2. Move the shift lever to the P (Park) or N (Neutral) position. (P is recommended.)  

The starter is designed not to operate unless the shift lever is in either of the above positions.  

3. Push the ignition switch to the ON position. Depress the brake pedal and push the ignition switch to start the engine.  

To start the engine immediately, push and release the ignition switch while depressing the brake pedal with the ignition switch in any position.  

If the engine is very hard to start in extremely cold weather or when restarting, depress the accelerator pedal a little (approximately 1/3 to the floor) and while holding, crank the engine. Release the accelerator pedal when the engine starts. If the engine is very hard to start because it is flooded, depress the accelerator pedal all the way to the floor and hold it. Push the ignition switch to the ON position to start cranking the engine. After 5 or 6 seconds, stop cranking by pushing the ignition switch to OFF. After cranking the engine, release the accelerator pedal. Crank the engine with your foot off the accelerator pedal by depressing the brake pedal and pushing the push-button ignition switch to start the engine. If the engine starts, but fails to run, repeat the above procedure.  

# CAUTION  

Do not operate the starter for more than 15 seconds at a time. If the engine does not start, push the ignition switch to OFF and wait 10 seconds before cranking again, otherwise the starter could be damaged.  

# 4. Warm-up  

Allow the engine to idle for at least 30 seconds after starting. Do not race the engine while warming it up. Drive at moderate speed for a short distance first, especially in cold weather. In cold weather, keep the engine running for a minimum of 2 - 3 minutes before shutting it off. Starting and stopping the engine over a short period of time may make the vehicle more difficult to start.  

5. To stop the engine, shift the shift lever to the P (Park) position and push the ignition switch to the OFF position.  

# NOTE:  

Care should be taken to avoid situations that can lead to potential battery discharge and potential no-start conditions such as:  

1. Installation or extended use of electronic accessories that consume battery power when the engine is not running (Phone chargers, GPS, DVD players, etc.)   
2. Vehicle is not driven regularly and/or only driven short distances.  

In these cases, the battery may need to be charged to maintain battery health.  

# DRIVING THE VEHICLE  

# CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION (CVT)  

The Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) in your vehicle is electronically controlled to produce maximum power and smooth operation.  

The recommended operating procedures for this transmission are shown on the following pages. Follow these procedures for maximum vehicle performance and driving enjoyment.  

Engine power may be automatically reduced to protect the CVT if the engine speed increases quickly when driving on slippery roads or while being tested on some dynamometers.  

# Starting the vehicle  

# ! CAUTION  

After starting the engine, fully depress the foot brake pedal before moving the shift lever out of the P (Park) position.   
This CVT is designed so that the foot brake pedal must be depressed before shifting from P (Park) to any driving position while the ignition switch is in the ON position.   
The shift lever cannot be moved out of the P (Park) position and into any of the other positions if the ignition switch is pushed to the LOCK, OFF or ACC position.   
2. Keep the foot brake pedal depressed and move the shift lever to a driving position.   
3. Release the parking brake and foot brake pedal, and then gradually start the vehicle in motion.  

# WARNING  

Do not depress the accelerator pedal while shifting from P (Park) or N (Neutral) to R (Reverse), D (Drive) or L (Low) position. Always depress the brake pedal until shifting is completed. Failure to do so could cause you to lose control and have an accident. Cold engine idle speed is high, so use caution when shifting into a forward or reverse gear before the engine has warmed up. Never shift to P (Park) or R (Reverse) while vehicle is moving. Failure to do so could cause you to lose control and have an accident.  

Except in an emergency, do not shift to the N (Neutral) position while driving. Coasting with the transmission in the N (Neutral) position may cause serious damage to the transmission.   
When stopping the vehicle on an uphill grade, do not hold the vehicle by depressing the accelerator pedal. The foot brake should be used for this purpose.   
Do not downshift abruptly on slippery roads. This may cause a loss of control.

# N (Neutral):  

Neither forward nor reverse gear is engaged. The engine can be started in this position. You may shift to N (Neutral) and restart a stalled engine while the vehicle is moving.  

# D (Drive):  

Use this position for all normal forward driving.  

# L (Low):  

Use this position for maximum engine braking on steep downhill gradients/climbing steep slopes and whenever approaching sharp bends. Do not use the L position in any other circumstances.  

![](images/65307d8a628af42a399d62cebf328892058561323657053822ace187e9c0e517.jpg)  

# Overdrive (O/D) OFF switch  

When the O/D OFF switch is pushed with the shift lever in the D (Drive) position, the indicator light in the instrument panel illuminates.  

Use the overdrive off mode when you need improved engine braking.  

To turn off the overdrive off mode, push the O/D OFF switch again. The indicator light will turn off.  

Each time the engine is started, or when the shift lever is shifted to any position other than the D (Drive) position, the overdrive off mode will be automatically turned off.  

Accelerator downshift — In D position — For passing or hill climbing, fully depress the accelerator pedal to the floor. This shifts the transmission down into a lower gear, depending on the vehicle speed.  

High fluid temperature protection mode This transmission has a high fluid temperature protection mode. If the fluid temperature becomes too high (for example, when climbing steep grades in high temperature with heavy loads, such as when towing a trailer), engine power and, under some conditions, vehicle speed will be decreased automatically to reduce the chance of transmission damage. Vehicle speed can be controlled with the accelerator pedal, but the engine and vehicle speed may be limited.  

# Fail-safe  

If the vehicle is driven under extreme conditions, such as excessive wheel spinning and subsequent hard braking, the fail-safe system may be activated. This will occur even if all electrical circuits are functioning properly. In this case, place the ignition switch in the OFF position and wait for 10 seconds. Then place the ignition switch back in the ON position. The vehicle should return to its normal operating condition. If it does not return to its normal operating condition, have a NISSAN dealer check the transmission and repair if necessary.  

# WARNING  

When the high fluid temperature protection mode or fail-safe operation occurs, vehicle speed may be gradually reduced. The reduced speed may be lower than other traffic, which could increase the chance of a collision. Be especially careful when driving. If necessary, pull to the side of the road at a safe place and allow the transmission to return to normal operation, or have it repaired if necessary.  

# PARKING BRAKE  

![](images/a0588f8a8dd73825c63db9e7172f86c388d670ace8570f449c9cfbc93c25bafd.jpg)

2. Depress the parking brake pedal $\textcircled{1}$ and the parking brake will be released.   
3. Before driving, be sure the brake warning light goes out.  

# WARNING  

The BSW system is not a replacement for proper driving procedure and is not designed to prevent contact with vehicles or objects. When changing lanes, always use the side and rear mirrors and turn and look in the direction you will move to ensure it is safe to change lanes. Never rely solely on the BSW system. The BSW system operates above approximately 20 MPH (32 km/h).  

The Blind Spot Warning (BSW) system can help alert the driver of other vehicles in adjacent lanes when changing lanes.  

![](images/22605b6d7f7bfb89712a047d2bd0e6b2c204a711bfa150ae2753b9726076f565.jpg)  

The BSW system uses radar sensors $\textcircled{4}$ installed near the rear bumper to detect other vehicles in an adjacent lane.  

![](images/31b42af5548c4f6bc6ae18683741dfec951fff3d864697b2e99faebcc81db8e0.jpg)  

# Detection zone  

The radar sensors can detect vehicles on either side of your vehicle within the detection zone shown as illustrated. This detection zone starts from the outside mirror of your vehicle and extends approximately 10 ft $(3\mathrm{m})$ behind the rear bumper, and approximately 10 ft $(3\mathrm{~m})$ sideways.  

The BSW system operates above approximately 20 MPH $(32~\mathrm{km/h})$ . If the radar sensors detect a vehicle in the detection zone, the BSW indicator light illuminates. If the driver then activates the turn signal, a chime will sound twice and the BSW indicator light will flash.  

![](images/0303f1e8fb4bf03c8d0077749b9b4b9e4884685f7fc09e737ee674ff48eacef6.jpg)

# BSW switch  

# BSW SYSTEM OPERATION  

If the radar sensors detect a vehicle in the detection zone, the BSW indicator light in the outside mirror will illuminate in the direction of the detected vehicle. If the turn signal is then activated, the system chimes (twice) and the BSW indicator light flashes. The BSW indicator light continues to flash until the detected vehicle leaves the detection zone.  

The BSW indicator lights illuminate for a few seconds when the ignition switch is placed in the ON position.  

The brightness of the BSW indicator lights is adjusted automatically depending on the brightness of the ambient light.  

A chime sounds if the radar sensors have already detected a vehicle when the driver activates the turn signal. If a vehicle comes into the detection zone after the driver activates the turn signal, then only the BSW indicator light flashes and no chime sounds. (See “BSW driving situations” (P.5-20).)  

The BSW system is automatically turned on when the engine is started and the BSW ON indicator light $\textcircled{1}$ on the switch illuminates. You can turn the BSW system off by pushing the BSW switch on the instrumental panel.  

# NOTE:  

If you continue to push and hold the BSW switch from off to on for over 4 seconds, a chime will sound. This will change the default status of the BSW system to OFF so that this system will not automatically turn on when the engine is started. If this procedure is repeated, the default status will return to ON.  

BSW temporarily not available  

When radar blockage is detected, the BSW system will be turned off automatically, a beep will sound and the BSW system warning light will blink. The BSW system is not available until the condition no longer exists.  

The radar sensors may be blocked by temporary ambient conditions such as splashing water, mist or fog. The blocked condition may also be caused by objects such as ice, frost or dirt obstructing the radar sensors.  

Action to take:  

When the above condition no longer exists, the BSW system will resume automatically. If the warning light continues to blink, have the BSW system checked by a NISSAN dealer.  

# BSW malfunction  

When the BSW system malfunctions, it will be turned off automatically, a beep will sound and the BSW system warning light will illuminate.  

Action to take:  

Stop the vehicle in a safe location and place the shift in the P (Park) position. Turn the engine off and restart the engine.  

If the warning light continues to illuminate, have the BSW system checked by a NISSAN dealer.  

# BSW SYSTEM PRECAUTIONS  

# WARNING  

The radar sensors may not be able to detect and activate BSW when certain objects are present such as:  

— Pedestrians, bicycles, animals   
— Vehicles such as motorcycles, low height vehicles, or high ground clearance vehicles   
— Oncoming vehicles   
— Vehicles remaining in the detection zone when you accelerate from a stop   
— A vehicle merging into an adjacent lane at a speed approximately the same as your vehicle   
— A vehicle approaching rapidly from behind   
— A vehicle which your vehicle overtakes rapidly   
See also “BSW driving situations”   
(P.5-20) for the situations in which   
the radar sensors may not be able   
to detect vehicle(s).   
The BSW system may not provide a   
warning for vehicles that pass the   
detection zone quickly.   
The radar sensors detection zone is   
designed based on a standard lane   
width. When driving in a wider lane,   
the radar sensors may not detect   
vehicles in an adjacent lane. When  

driving in a narrow lane, the radar sensors may detect vehicles driving two lanes away.  

The radar sensors are designed to ignore most stationary objects, however objects such as guardrails, walls, foliage and parked vehicles may occasionally be detected. This is a normal operating condition. Severe weather or road spray conditions may reduce the ability of the radar to detect other vehicles. Do not use the BSW system when towing a trailer because the system may not function properly. Excessive noise (for example, audio system volume, open vehicle window) will interfere with the chime sound, and it may not be heard.

# RADAR MAINTENANCE  

The two radar sensors $\textcircled{4}$ for the BSW system are located near the rear bumper. Always keep the area near the radar sensors clean.  

The radar sensors may be blocked by temporary ambient conditions such splashing water, mist or fog.  

The blocked condition may also be caused by objects such as ice, frost or dirt obstructing the radar sensors.  

Check for and remove objects obstructing the area around the radar sensors.  

Do not attach stickers (including transparent material), install accessories or apply additional paint near the radar sensors.  

Do not strike or damage the area around the radar sensors. Consult a NISSAN dealer if the area around the radar sensors is damaged due to a collision.

# CRUISE CONTROL  

# PRECAUTIONS ON CRUISE CONTROL  

If the cruise control system malfunctions, it will cancel automatically. The CRUISE indicator light on the meter panel will then blink to warn the driver.   
If the engine coolant temperature becomes excessively high, the cruise control system will cancel automatically.   
If the CRUISE indicator light blinks, turn the cruise control main switch off and have the system checked by a NISSAN dealer.   
The CRUISE indicator light may blink when the cruise control main switch is turned ON while pushing the ACCELERATE/RESUME, COAST/SET or CANCEL switch. To properly set the cruise control system, perform the following procedures.  

# WARNING  

Do not use the cruise control when driving under the following conditions:  

when it is not possible to keep the vehicle at a set speed   
in heavy traffic or in traffic that varies in speed   
on winding or hilly roads   
on slippery roads (rain, snow, ice,   
etc.)   
in very windy areas  

Doing so could cause a loss of vehicle control and result in an accident.  

![](images/4430feba84b2400567284c16e746305bc4db71e6b87e019cb2d79ade39a4cb27.jpg)  

1. ACCELERATE/RESUME switch  
2. COAST/SET switch  
3. CANCEL switch  
4. MAIN (ON·OFF) switch  

# CRUISE CONTROL OPERATIONS  

The cruise control allows driving at a speed between 25 to 89 MPH (40 to $144~\mathrm{km/h)}$ without keeping your foot on the accelerator pedal.  

To turn on the cruise control, push the MAIN switch on. The CRUISE indicator light will illuminate.  

To set cruising speed, accelerate the vehicle to the desired speed, push the COAST/SET switch and release it. Take your foot off the  

# BREAK-IN SCHEDULE  

accelerator pedal. Your vehicle will maintain the set speed.  

To pass another vehicle, depress the accelerator pedal. When you release the pedal, the vehicle will return to the previously set speed. The vehicle may not maintain the set speed on winding or hilly roads. If this happens, drive without the cruise control.  

To cancel the preset speed, use one of the following methods:  

1. Push the CANCEL switch.   
2. Tap the brake pedal.   
3. Turn the MAIN switch off. The CRUISE light will turn off. If you depress the brake pedal while pushing the ACCELERATE/RESUME or COAST/ SET switch and reset at the cruising speed, the cruise control will disengage. Turn the MAIN switch off once and then turn it on again. The cruise control will automatically cancel if the vehicle slows more than 8 MPH (13 $k m/h)$ below the set speed. If you move the shift lever to the N (Neutral) position, the cruise control will be canceled.  

To reset at a faster cruising speed, use one of the following methods:  

Depress the accelerator pedal. When the vehicle attains the desired speed, push and release the COAST/SET switch.   
Push and hold the ACCELERATE/RESUME switch. When the vehicle attains the desired speed, release the switch.   
Push, then quickly release the ACCELERATE/RESUME switch. Each time you do this, the set speed will increase by about 1 MPH $\left(1.6~\mathsf{k m/h}\right)$ .  

To reset at a slower cruising speed, use one of the following methods:  

Lightly tap the brake pedal. When the vehicle attains the desired speed, push the COAST/SET switch and release it. Push and hold the COAST/SET switch. Release the switch when the vehicle slows down to the desired speed. Push, then quickly release the COAST/SET switch. Each time you do this, the set speed will decrease by about 1 MPH $\left(1.6~\mathsf{k m/h}\right)$ .  

To resume the preset speed, push and release the ACCELERATE/RESUME switch. The vehicle will resume the last set cruising speed when the vehicle speed is over 25 MPH $(40~\mathsf{k m/h})$ .  

# CAUTION  

During the first 1,200 miles $(\pmb{2},000~\mathrm{km})$ , follow these recommendations to obtain maximum engine performance and ensure the future reliability and economy of your new vehicle. Failure to follow these recommendations may result in shortened engine life and reduced engine performance.  

Avoid driving for long periods at constant speed, either fast or slow. Do not run the engine over 4,000 rpm.   
. Do not accelerate at full throttle in any gear.   
. Avoid quick starts.   
$\bullet$ Avoid hard braking as much as possible. Do not tow a trailer for the first 500 miles $(800~\mathsf{k m})$ . Your engine, axle or other parts could be damaged.  

# FUEL EFFICIENT DRIVING TIPS  

Follow these easy-to-use Fuel Efficient Driving Tips to help you achieve the most fuel economy from your vehicle.  

1. Use smooth accelerator and brake pedal application.  

. Avoid rapid starts and stops. . Use smooth, gentle accelerator and brake application whenever possible. Maintain constant speed while commuting and coast whenever possible.  

2. Maintain constant speed.  

. Look ahead to try and anticipate and minimize stops. Synchronizing your speed with traffic lights allows you to reduce your number of stops. Maintaining a steady speed can minimize red light stops and improve fuel efficiency.  

3. Use air conditioning (A/C) at higher vehicle speeds.  

Below 40 MPH $(64~\mathrm{km/h})$ , it is more efficient to open windows to cool the vehicle due to reduced engine load. . Above 40 MPH $(64~\mathrm{km/h})$ , it is more efficient to use A/C to cool the vehicle due to increased aerodynamic drag.  

. Recirculating the cool air in the cabin when the A/C is on reduces cooling load.  

4. Drive at economical speeds and distances.  

. Observing the speed limit and not exceeding 60 MPH $(97\mathrm{km/h)}$ (where legally allowed) can improve fuel efficiency due to reduced aerodynamic drag. Maintaining a safe following distance behind other vehicles reduces unnecessary braking. Safely monitoring traffic to anticipate changes in speed permits reduced braking and smooth acceleration changes. Select a gear range suitable to road conditions.  

5. Use cruise control.  

. Using cruise control during highway driving helps maintain a steady speed. Cruise control is particularly effective in providing fuel savings when driving on flat terrains.  

6. Plan for the shortest route. Utilize a map or navigation system to determine the best route to save time.  

7. Avoid idling.  

. Shutting off your engine when safe for stops exceeding 30-60 seconds saves fuel and reduces emissions.  

8. Buy an automated pass for toll roads.  

. Automated passes permit drivers to use special lanes to maintain cruising speed through the toll and avoid stopping and starting.  

9. Winter warm up.  

. Limit idling time to minimize impact to fuel economy.   
. Vehicles typically need no more than 30 seconds of idling at start-up to effectively circulate the engine oil before driving.   
Your vehicle will reach its ideal operating temperature more quickly while driving versus idling.  

10. Keeping your vehicle cool.  

. Park your vehicle in a covered parking area or in the shade whenever possible. When entering a hot vehicle, opening the windows will help to reduce the inside temperature faster, resulting in reduced demand on your A/C system.  

# INCREASING FUEL ECONOMY  

. Keep your engine tuned up.   
. Follow the recommended scheduled maintenance. Keep the tires inflated to the correct pressure. Low tire pressure increases tire wear and lowers fuel economy. Keep the wheels in correct alignment. Improper alignment increases tire wear and lowers fuel economy. Use the recommended viscosity engine oil. (See “Engine oil and oil filter recommendation” (P.9-5).)  

![](images/d4e56defcba0e1eaa54ee004c169041b94e5ec889af5bb96ca43652d37f8b38a.jpg)  

# WARNING  

Do not stop or park the vehicle over flammable materials such as dry grass, waste paper or rags. They may ignite and cause a fire. Safe parking procedures require that both the parking brake be set and the transmission placed into P (Park). Failure to do so could cause the vehicle to move unexpectedly or roll away and result in an accident. Make sure the shift lever has been pushed as far forward as it can go and cannot be moved without depressing the foot brake pedal. Never leave the engine running while the vehicle is unattended. Do not leave children unattended inside the vehicle. They could unknowingly activate switches or controls. Unattended children could become involved in serious accidents.  

1. Firmly apply the parking brake.   
2. Move the shift lever to the P (Park) position.  

# HYDRAULIC PUMP ELECTRIC POWER STEERING SYSTEM  

3. To help prevent the vehicle from rolling into traffic when parked on an incline, it is a good practice to turn the wheels as illustrated.  

. HEADED DOWNHILL WITH CURB: $\textcircled{1}$ Turn the wheels into the curb and move the vehicle forward until the curb side wheel gently touches the curb. . HEADED UPHILL WITH CURB: $\textcircled{2}$ Turn the wheels away from the curb and move the vehicle back until the curb side wheel gently touches the curb. HEADED UPHILL OR DOWNHILL, NO CURB: $\textcircled{3}$ Turn the wheels toward the side of the road so the vehicle will move away from the center of the road if it moves.  

4. Push the ignition switch to the LOCK position.  

# WARNING  

If the engine is not running or is turned off while driving, the power assist for the steering will not work. Steering will be harder to operate. When the hydraulic pump electric power steering warning light illuminates with the engine running, the power assist for the steering will cease operation. You will still have control of the vehicle, but the steering will be much harder to operate.  

The hydraulic pump electric power steering system is designed to provide power assistance while driving to operate the steering wheel with light force.  

When the steering wheel is operated repeatedly or continuously while parking or driving at a very low speed, the power assist for the steering wheel will be reduced. This is to prevent overheating of the hydraulic pump electric power steering system and protect it from getting damaged. While the power assist is reduced, steering wheel operation will become heavy. If the steering wheel operation is still performed, the power steering may stop and the hydraulic pump electric power steering warning light will illuminate. Stop the engine and push the ignition switch to the OFF position. The temperature of the hydraulic pump electric power steering system will go down and the power assist level will return to normal after starting the engine. The hydraulic pump electric power steering warning light will go off. Avoid repeating such steering wheel operations that could cause the hydraulic pump electric power steering system to overheat.  

You may hear a noise from the front of the vehicle when the steering wheel is operated. This is not a malfunction.  

If the hydraulic pump electric power steering warning light illuminates while the engine is running, it may indicate the hydraulic pump electric power steering system is not functioning properly and may need servicing. Have the hydraulic pump electric power steering system checked by a NISSAN dealer.  

When the hydraulic pump electric power steering warning light illuminates with the engine running, the power assist for the steering will cease operation but you will still have control of the vehicle. At this time, greater steering efforts are required to operate the steering wheel, especially in sharp turns and at low speeds.  

# BRAKE SYSTEM  

# BRAKING PRECAUTIONS  

The brake system has two separate hydraulic circuits. If one circuit malfunctions, you will still have braking at two wheels.  

# Vacuum assisted brakes  

The brake booster aids braking by using engine vacuum. If the engine stops, you can stop the vehicle by depressing the brake pedal. However, greater foot pressure on the brake pedal will be required to stop the vehicle and the stopping distance will be longer.  

# Using the brakes  

Avoid resting your foot on the brake pedal while driving. This will cause overheating of the brakes, wearing out the brake and pads faster and reduce gas mileage.  

To help reduce brake wear and to prevent the brakes from overheating, reduce speed and downshift to a lower gear before going down a slope or long grade. Overheated brakes may reduce braking performance and could result in loss of vehicle control.  

# WARNING  

While driving on a slippery surface, be careful when braking, accelerating or downshifting. Abrupt braking or accelerating could cause the wheels to skid and result in an accident. If the engine is not running or is turned off while driving, the power assist for the brakes will not work. Braking will be harder.  

# Wet brakes  

When the vehicle is washed or driven through water, the brakes may get wet. As a result, your braking distance will be longer and the vehicle may pull to one side during braking.  

To dry brakes, drive the vehicle at a safe speed while lightly tapping the brake pedal to heat-up the brakes. Do this until the brakes return to normal. Avoid driving the vehicle at high speeds until the brakes function correctly.  

# PARKING BRAKE BREAK-IN  

Break in the parking brake shoes whenever the stopping effect of the parking brake is weakened or whenever the parking brake shoes and/or drums/rotors are replaced, in order to assure the best braking performance.  

This procedure is described in the vehicle service manual and can be performed by a NISSAN dealer.  

# ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS)  

# WARNING  

The Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) is a sophisticated device, but it cannot prevent accidents resulting from careless or dangerous driving techniques. It can help maintain vehicle control during braking on slippery surfaces. Remember that stopping distances on slippery surfaces will be longer than on normal surfaces even with ABS. Stopping distances may also be longer on rough, gravel or snow covered roads, or if you are using tire chains. Always maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you. Ultimately, the driver is responsible for safety.   
Tire type and condition may also affect braking effectiveness.   
— When replacing tires, install the specified size of tires on all four wheels.   
— When installing a spare tire, make sure that it is the proper size and type as specified on the  

Tire and Loading Information label. See “Tire and Loading Information label” (P.9-10). — For detailed information, see “Wheels and tires” (P.8-30).  

The Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) controls the brakes so the wheels do not lock during hard braking or when braking on slippery surfaces. The system detects the rotation speed at each wheel and varies the brake fluid pressure to prevent each wheel from locking and sliding. By preventing each wheel from locking, the system helps the driver maintain steering control and helps to minimize swerving and spinning on slippery surfaces.  

# Using the system  

Depress the brake pedal and hold it down. Depress the brake pedal with firm steady pressure, but do not pump the brakes. The ABS will operate to prevent the wheels from locking up. Steer the vehicle to avoid obstacles.  

# WARNING  

Do not pump the brake pedal. Doing so may result in increased stopping distances.  

5-30 Starting and driving  

# Self-test feature  

The ABS includes electronic sensors, electric pumps, hydraulic solenoids and a computer. The computer has a built-in diagnostic feature that tests the system each time you start the engine and move the vehicle at a low speed in forward or reverse. When the self-test occurs, you may hear a “clunk” noise and/or feel a pulsation in the brake pedal. This is normal and does not indicate a malfunction. If the computer senses a malfunction, it switches the ABS off and illuminates the ABS warning light on the instrument panel. The brake system then operates normally, but without anti-lock assistance.  

If the ABS warning light illuminates during the self-test or while driving, have the vehicle checked by a NISSAN dealer.  

# Normal operation  

The ABS operates at speeds above 3 to 6 MPH (5 to $10k m/\hslash$ . The speed varies according to road conditions.  

When the ABS senses that one or more wheels are close to locking up, the actuator rapidly applies and releases hydraulic pressure. This action is similar to pumping the brakes very quickly. You may feel a pulsation in the brake pedal and hear a noise from under the hood or feel a vibration from the actuator when it is operating. This is normal and indicates that the ABS is operating properly. However, the pulsation may indicate that road conditions are hazardous and extra care is required while driving.  

# VEHICLE DYNAMIC CONTROL (VDC) SYSTEM  

The Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) system uses various sensors to monitor driver inputs and vehicle motion. Under certain driving conditions, the VDC system helps to perform the following functions.  

Controls brake pressure to reduce wheel slip on one slipping drive wheel so power is transferred to a non slipping drive wheel on the same axle.   
Controls brake pressure and engine output to reduce drive wheel slip based on vehicle speed (traction control function).   
Controls brake pressure at individual wheels and engine output to help the driver maintain control of the vehicle in the following conditions:  

— understeer (vehicle tends to not follow the steered path despite increased steering input) — oversteer (vehicle tends to spin due to certain road or driving conditions).  

The VDC system can help the driver to maintain control of the vehicle, but it cannot prevent loss of vehicle control in all driving situations.  

When the VDC system operates, the VDC warning light $\clubsuit$ in the instrument panel flashes so note the following:  

The road may be slippery or the system may determine some action is required to help keep the vehicle on the steered path. You may feel a pulsation in the brake pedal and hear a noise or vibration from under the hood. This is normal and indicates that the VDC system is working properly. Adjust your speed and driving to the road conditions.  

See “Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) warning light” (P.2-16).  

If a malfunction occurs in the system, the VDC warning light illuminates in the instrument panel. The VDC system automatically turns off. The VDC OFF switch is used to turn off the VDC system. The VDC off indicator light illuminates to indicate the VDC system is off. When the VDC switch is used to turn off the system, the VDC system still operates to prevent one drive wheel from slipping by transferring power to a non slipping drive wheel. The VDC warning light $\clubsuit$ flashes if this occurs. All other VDC functions are off, and the VDC warning light $\clubsuit$ will not flash. The VDC system is automatically reset to on when the ignition switch is placed in the off position then back to the on position.  

See “Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) warning light” (P.2-16) and “Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) off indicator light” (P.2-18).  

The computer has a built-in diagnostic feature that tests the system each time you start the engine and move the vehicle forward or in reverse at a slow speed. When the self-test occurs, you may hear a “clunk” noise and/or feel a pulsation in the brake pedal. This is normal and is not an indication of a malfunction.  

# WARNING  

The VDC system is designed to help the driver maintain stability but does not prevent accidents due to abrupt steering operation at high speeds or by careless or dangerous driving techniques. Reduce vehicle speed and be especially careful when driving and cornering on slippery surfaces and always drive carefully. Do not modify the vehicle’s suspension. If suspension parts such as shock absorbers, struts, springs, stabilizer bars, bushings and wheels are not NISSAN recommended for your vehicle or are extremely deteriorated, the VDC system may not operate properly. This could adversely affect vehicle handling performance, and the VDC  

# COLD WEATHER DRIVING  

warning light $\clubsuit$ may illuminate.  

If brake related parts such as brake pads, rotors and calipers are not NISSAN recommended or are extremely deteriorated, the VDC system may not operate properly and the VDC warning light may illuminate. If engine control related parts are not NISSAN recommended or are extremely deteriorated, the VDC warning light $\clubsuit$ may illuminate. When driving on extremely inclined surfaces such as higher banked corners, the VDC system may not operate properly and the VDC warning light $\clubsuit$ may illuminate. Do not drive on these types of roads. When driving on an unstable surface such as a turntable, ferry, elevator or ramp, the VDC warning light may illuminate. This is not a malfunction. Restart the engine after driving onto a stable surface. If wheels or tires other than the NISSAN recommended ones are used, the VDC system may not operate properly and the VDC warning light $\clubsuit$ may illuminate. The VDC system is not a substitute for winter tires or tire chains on a snow covered road.  

# FREEING A FROZEN DOOR LOCK  

To prevent a door lock from freezing, apply deicer through the key hole. If the lock becomes frozen, heat the key before inserting it into the key hole or use the remote keyless entry key fob.  

# ANTI-FREEZE  

In the winter when it is anticipated that the outside temperature will drop below $32^{\circ}\mathsf{F}\left(0^{\circ}\mathsf{C}\right)$ , check the anti-freeze to assure proper winter protection. For additional information, see “Engine cooling system” (P.8-7).  

# BATTERY  

If the battery is not fully charged during extremely cold weather conditions, the battery fluid may freeze and damage the battery. To maintain maximum efficiency, the battery should be checked regularly. For additional information, see “Battery” (P.8-13).  

# DRAINING OF COOLANT WATER  

If the vehicle is to be left outside without antifreeze, drain the cooling system, including the engine block. Refill before operating the vehicle. For details, see “Engine cooling system” (P.8-7).  

# TIRE EQUIPMENT  

SUMMER tires have a tread designed to provide superior performance on dry pavement. However, the performance of these tires will be substantially reduced in snowy and icy conditions. If you operate your vehicle on snowy or icy roads, NISSAN recommends the use of MUD & SNOW or ALL SEASON tires on all four wheels. Consult a NISSAN dealer for the tire type, size, speed rating and availability information.  

For additional traction on icy roads, studded tires may be used. However, some U.S. states and Canadian provinces prohibit their use. Check local, state and provincial laws before installing studded tires.  

Skid and traction capabilities of studded snow tires, on wet or dry surfaces, may be poorer than that of non-studded snow tires.  

Tire chains may be used. For details, see “Tire chains” (P.8-36).  

# SPECIAL WINTER EQUIPMENT  

It is recommended that the following items be carried in the vehicle during winter:  

A scraper and stiff-bristled brush to remove ice and snow from the windows and wiper blades.  

A sturdy, flat board to be placed under the jack to give it firm support.   
A shovel to dig the vehicle out of snowdrifts.   
Extra window washer fluid to refill the reservoir tank.  

# DRIVING ON SNOW OR ICE  

# WARNING  

Wet ice $({\mathfrak{s}}2^{\circ}{\mathfrak{F}},$ ${\pmb0}^{\circ}{\pmb\mathbb{C}}$ and freezing rain), very cold snow or ice can be slick and very hard to drive on. The vehicle will have much less traction or “grip” under these conditions. Try to avoid driving on wet ice until the road is salted or sanded.   
Whatever the condition, drive with caution. Accelerate and slow down with care. If accelerating or downshifting too fast, the drive wheels will lose even more traction.   
Allow more stopping distance under these conditions. Braking should be started sooner than on dry pavement.   
Allow greater following distances on slippery roads.  

Watch for slippery spots (glare ice). These may appear on an otherwise clear road in shaded areas. If a patch of ice is seen ahead, brake before reaching it. Try not to brake while on the ice, and avoid any sudden steering maneuvers. Do not use cruise control on slippery roads. Snow can trap dangerous exhaust gases under your vehicle. Keep snow clear of the exhaust pipe and from around your vehicle.  

# ENGINE BLOCK HEATER (if so equipped)  

Engine block heaters are used to assist with cold temperature starting.  

The engine block heater should be used when the outside temperature is $20^{\circ}\mathsf{F}$ $(-7^{\circ}\mathsf{C})$ or lower.  

To use the engine block heater  

1. Turn the engine off.   
2. Open the hood and unwrap the engine block heater cord.   
3. Plug the engine block heater cord into a grounded 3-wire, 3-pronged extension cord.   
4. Plug the extension cord into a Ground Fault Interrupt (GFI) protected, grounded 110- volt AC (VAC) outlet.   
5. The engine block heater must be plugged in for at least 2 - 4 hours, depending on outside temperatures, to properly warm the engine coolant. Use an appropriate timer to turn the engine block heater on.

# FLAT TIRE  

# TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM (TPMS)  

This vehicle is equipped with the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS). It monitors tire pressure of all tires except the spare. When the low tire pressure warning light is lit and the CHECK TIRE PRESSURE warning appears on the vehicle information display, one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated. If the vehicle is being driven with low tire pressure, the TPMS will activate and warn you of it by the low tire pressure warning light. This system will activate only when the vehicle is driven at speeds above 16 MPH $\scriptstyle25~{\mathsf{k m}}/{\mathsf{h}})$ . For more details, see “Warning/indicator lights and audible reminders” (P.2-11) and “Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)” (P.5-3).  

# WARNING  

If the low tire pressure warning light illuminates while driving, avoid sudden steering maneuvers or abrupt braking, reduce vehicle speed, pull off the road to a safe location and stop the vehicle as soon as possible. Driving with under-inflated tires may permanently damage the tires and increase the likelihood of tire  

failure. Serious vehicle damage could occur and may lead to an accident and could result in serious personal injury. Check the tire pressure for all four tires. Adjust the tire pressure to the recommended COLD tire pressure shown on the Tire and Loading Information label to turn the low tire pressure warning light OFF. If the light still illuminates while driving after adjusting the tire pressure, a tire may be flat. If you have a flat tire, replace it with a spare tire as soon as possible.   
When a spare tire is mounted or a wheel is replaced, the TPMS will not function and the low tire pressure warning light will flash for approximately 1 minute. The light will remain on after 1 minute. Contact your NISSAN dealer as soon as possible for tire replacement and/ or system resetting.   
Replacing tires with those not originally specified by NISSAN could affect the proper operation of the TPMS.   
Do not inject any tire liquid or aerosol tire sealant into the tires,  

# as this may cause a malfunction of the tire pressure sensors.  

# CHANGING A FLAT TIRE

7. After starting your engine, carefully disconnect the negative cable and then the positive cable $\left(\textcircled{4}\to\textcircled{3}\to\textcircled{2}\to\textcircled{1}\right)$ .   
8. Replace the vent caps (if so equipped). Be sure to dispose of the cloth used to cover the vent holes as it may be contaminated with corrosive acid.  

# PUSH STARTING  

Do not attempt to start the engine by pushing.  

# CAUTION  

Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) models cannot be push-started or tow-started. Attempting to do so may cause transmission damage.  

# IF YOUR VEHICLE OVERHEATS  

# CAUTION  

Do not continue to drive if your vehicle overheats. Doing so could cause engine damage or a vehicle fire.   
To avoid the danger of being scalded, never remove the radiator cap while the engine is still hot. When the radiator cap is removed, pressurized hot water will spurt out, possibly causing serious injury.   
Do not open the hood if steam is coming out.  

If your vehicle is overheating (indicated by an extremely high temperature gauge reading), or if you feel a lack of engine power, detect abnormal noise, etc., take the following steps:  

1. Move the vehicle safely off the road, apply the parking brake and move the shift lever to the P (Park) position. Do not stop the engine.   
2. Turn off the air conditioner. Open all the windows, move the heater or air conditioner temperature control to maximum hot and fan control to high speed.  

3. Get out of the vehicle. Look and listen for steam or coolant escaping from the radiator before opening the hood. (If steam or coolant is escaping, turn off the engine.) Do not open the hood further until no steam or coolant can be seen.  

4. Open the engine hood.  

# WARNING  

If steam or water is coming from the engine, stand clear to prevent getting burned.  

5. Visually check drive belts for damage or looseness. Also check if the cooling fan is running. The radiator hoses and radiator should not leak water. If coolant is leaking, the water pump belt is missing or loose, or the cooling fan does not run, stop the engine.

To protect your vehicle from corrosion 7-7  

In order to maintain the appearance of your vehicle, it is important to take proper care of it.  

To protect the paint surface, wash your vehicle as soon as you can:  

after a rainfall to prevent possible damage from acid rain . after driving on coastal roads when contaminants such as soot, bird droppings, tree sap, metal particles or bugs get on the paint surface when dust or mud builds up on the surface  

Whenever possible, store or park your vehicle inside a garage or in a covered area.  

When it is necessary to park outside, park in a shady area or protect the vehicle with a body cover.  

# Be careful not to scratch the paint surface when putting on or removing the body cover.  

# WASHING  

Wash dirt off the vehicle with a wet sponge and plenty of water. Clean the vehicle thoroughly using a mild soap, a special vehicle soap or general purpose dishwashing liquid mixed with clean, lukewarm (never hot) water.  

# ! CAUTION  

Do not use car washes that use acid in the detergent. Some car washes, especially brushless ones, use some acid for cleaning. The acid may react with some plastic vehicle components, causing them to crack. This could affect their appearance, and also could cause them not to function properly. Always check with your car wash to confirm that acid is not used.   
Do not wash the vehicle with strong household soap, strong chemical detergents, gasoline or solvents. Do not wash the vehicle in direct sunlight or while the vehicle body is hot, as the surface may become water-spotted.   
Avoid using tight-napped or rough cloths, such as washing mitts. Care must be taken when removing caked-on dirt or other foreign substances so the paint surface is not scratched or damaged.  

Rinse the vehicle again with plenty of clean  

water.  

Inside flanges, seams and folds on the doors, hatches and hood are particularly vulnerable to the effects of road salt. Therefore, these areas must be regularly cleaned. Make sure that the drain holes in the lower edge of the door are open. Spray water under the body and in the wheel wells to loosen the dirt and wash away road salt.  

Avoid leaving water spots on the paint surface by using a damp chamois to dry the vehicle.  

# WAXING  

Regular waxing protects the paint surface and helps retain new vehicle appearance. Polishing is recommended to remove built-up wax residue and to avoid a weathered appearance before reapplying wax.  

A NISSAN dealer can assist you in choosing the proper product.  

Wax your vehicle only after a thorough washing. Follow the instructions supplied with the wax.   
Do not use a wax containing any abrasives, cutting compounds or cleaners that may damage the vehicle finish.  

Machine compound or aggressive polishing on a base coat/clear coat paint finish may dull the finish or leave swirl marks.  

# REMOVING SPOTS  

Remove tar and oil spots, industrial dust, insects, and tree sap as quickly as possible from the paint surface to avoid lasting damage or staining. Special cleaning products are available at a NISSAN dealer or any automotive accessory stores.  

# UNDERBODY  

In areas where road salt is used in winter, the underbody must be cleaned regularly. This will prevent dirt and salt from building up and causing the acceleration of corrosion on the underbody and suspension. Before the winter period and again in the spring, the underseal must be checked and, if necessary, re-treated.  

# GLASS  

Use glass cleaner to remove smoke and dust film from the glass surfaces. It is normal for glass to become coated with a film after the vehicle is parked in the hot sun. Glass cleaner and a soft cloth will easily remove this film.  

# CAUTION  

When cleaning the inside of the windows, do not use sharp-edged tools, abrasive cleaners or chlorine-based disinfectant cleaners. They could damage the electrical conductors, radio antenna elements or rear window defroster elements.  

# WHEELS  

Wash the wheels when washing the vehicle to maintain their appearance.  

Clean the inner side of the wheels when the wheel is changed or the underside of the vehicle is washed. Inspect wheel rims regularly for dents or corrosion. Such damage may cause loss of pressure or poor seal at the tire bead. NISSAN recommends that the road wheels be waxed to protect against road salt in areas where it is used during winter.  

# CAUTION  

Do not use abrasive cleaners when washing the wheels.  

# Aluminum alloy wheels  

Wash regularly with a sponge dampened in a mild soap solution, especially during winter months in areas where road salt is used. Salt could discolor the wheels if not removed.  

# CAUTION  

Follow the directions below to avoid staining or discoloring the wheels:  

Do not use a cleaner that uses strong acid or alkali contents to clean the wheels. Do not apply wheel cleaners to the wheels when they are hot. The wheel temperature should be the same as ambient temperature. Rinse the wheel to completely remove the cleaner within 15 minutes after the cleaner is applied.  

# CHROME PARTS  

Clean chrome parts regularly with a nonabrasive chrome polish to maintain the finish.  

# TIRE DRESSING  

NISSAN does not recommend the use of tire dressings. Tire manufacturers apply a coating to the tires to help reduce discoloration of the rubber. If a tire dressing is applied to the tires, it may react with the coating and form a compound. This compound may come off the tire while driving and stain the vehicle paint.  

If you choose to use a tire dressing, take the following precautions:  

Use a water-based tire dressing. The coating on the tire dissolves more easily with an oil-based tire dressing.   
Apply a light coat of tire dressing to help prevent it from entering the tire tread/ grooves (where it would be difficult to remove).   
Wipe off excess tire dressing using a dry towel. Make sure the tire dressing is completely removed from the tire tread/ grooves.   
Allow the tire dressing to dry as recommended by tire dressing manufacturer.  

# CLEANING INTERIOR  

Occasionally remove loose dust from the interior trim, plastic parts and seats using a vacuum cleaner or soft bristled brush. Wipe the vinyl and leather surfaces with a clean, soft cloth dampened in mild soap solution, then wipe clean with a dry soft cloth.  

Regular care and cleaning is required in order to maintain the appearance of the leather.  

Before using any fabric protector, read the manufacturer’s recommendations. Some fabric protectors contain chemicals that may stain or bleach the seat material.  

Use a cloth dampened only with water, to clean the meter and gauge lens.  

# WARNING  

Do not use water or acidic cleaners (hot steam cleaners) on the seat. This can damage the seat or occupant classification sensor. This can also affect the operation of the air bag system and result in serious personal injury.  

# ! CAUTION  

Never use benzine, thinner, or any similar material.   
For cleaning, use a soft cloth, dampened with water. Never use a rough cloth, alcohol, benzine, thinner or any kind of solvent or paper towel with a chemical cleaning agent. They will scratch or cause discoloration to the lens.   
Do not spray any liquid such as water on the meter lens. Spraying liquid may cause the system to malfunction.   
Small dirt particles can be abrasive and damaging to the leather surfaces and should be removed promptly. Do not use saddle soap, car waxes, polishes, oils, cleaning fluids, solvents, detergents or ammonia-based cleaners as they may damage the leather’s natural finish. Never use fabric protectors unless recommended by the manufacturer. Do not use glass or plastic cleaner on meter or gauge lens covers. It  

# may damage the lens cover.  

# AIR FRESHENERS  

Most air fresheners use a solvent that could affect the vehicle interior. If you use an air freshener, take the following precautions:  

Hanging-type air fresheners can cause permanent discoloration when they contact vehicle interior surfaces. Place the air freshener in a location that allows it to hang free and not contact an interior surface. Liquid-type air fresheners typically clip on the ventilators. These products can cause immediate damage and discoloration when spilled on interior surfaces.  

Carefully read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions before using air fresheners.  

# FLOOR MATS  

# WARNING  

To avoid potential pedal interference that may result in a collision or injury:  

NEVER place a floor mat on top of another floor mat in the driver front position.   
Use only genuine NISSAN floor mats specifically designed for use in your vehicle model. See your NISSAN dealer for more information.   
Properly position the mats in the floorwell using the floor mat positioning aid. See “Floor mat positioning aid” (P.7-5).  

The use of genuine NISSAN floor mats can extend the life of your vehicle carpet and make it easier to clean the interior. Mats should be maintained with regular cleaning and replaced if they become excessively worn.

Bracket positions  

The illustration shows the location of the floor mat brackets.  

# SEAT BELTS  

The seat belts can be cleaned by wiping them with a sponge dampened in a mild soap solution. Allow the belts to dry completely before using them.  

See “Seat belts” (P.1-15).  

![](images/dd219ccc6c2a5b3683a8f256d802ff938250d590d7b7f8f95a8f4176574eda4e.jpg)  

# WARNING  

Do not allow wet seat belts to roll up in the retractor. NEVER use bleach, dye, or chemical solvents to clean the seat  

belts, since these materials may severely weaken the seat belt webbing.  

# MOST COMMON FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO VEHICLE CORROSION  

The accumulation of moisture-retaining dirt and debris in body panel sections, cavities, and other areas.   
Damage to paint and other protective coatings caused by gravel and stone chips or minor traffic accidents.  

# ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INFLUENCE THE RATE OF CORROSION  

# Moisture  

Accumulation of sand, dirt and water on the vehicle body underside can accelerate corrosion. Wet floor coverings will not dry completely inside the vehicle, and should be removed for drying to avoid floor panel corrosion.  

# Relative humidity  

Corrosion will be accelerated in areas of high relative humidity, especially those areas where the temperatures stay above freezing where atmospheric pollution exists, or where road salt is used.  

7-6 Appearance and care  

# Temperature  

A temperature increase will accelerate the rate of corrosion to those parts which are not well ventilated.  

# Air pollution  

Industrial pollution, the presence of salt in the air in coastal areas, or heavy road salt use will accelerate the corrosion process. Road salt will also accelerate the disintegration of paint surfaces.  

# TO PROTECT YOUR VEHICLE FROM CORROSION  

Wash and wax your vehicle often to keep the vehicle clean.   
Always check for minor damage to the paint and repair it as soon as possible.   
Keep drain holes at the bottom of the doors open to avoid water accumulation.   
Check the underbody for accumulation of sand, dirt or salt. If present, wash with water as soon as possible.  

# CAUTION  

NEVER remove dirt, sand or other debris from the passenger compartment by washing it out with a hose.  

Remove dirt with a vacuum cleaner. Never allow water or other liquids to come in contact with electronic components inside the vehicle as this may damage them.  

Chemicals used for road surface deicing are extremely corrosive. They accelerate corrosion and deterioration of underbody components such as the exhaust system, fuel and brake lines, brake cables, floor pan and fenders.  

# In winter, the underbody must be cleaned periodically.  

For additional protection against rust and corrosion, which may be required in some areas, consult a NISSAN dealer.

Some day-to-day and regular maintenance is essential to maintain your vehicle’s good mechanical condition, as well as its emission and engine performance.  

It is the owner’s responsibility to make sure that the scheduled maintenance, as well as general maintenance, is performed.  

As the vehicle owner, you are the only one who can ensure that your vehicle receives the proper maintenance. You are a vital link in the maintenance chain.  

# SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE  

For your convenience, both required and optional scheduled maintenance items are described and listed in your “NISSAN Service and Maintenance Guide”. You must refer to that guide to ensure that necessary maintenance is performed on your vehicle at regular intervals.  

# GENERAL MAINTENANCE  

General maintenance includes those items which should be checked during normal dayto-day operation. They are essential for proper vehicle operation. It is your responsibility to perform these procedures regularly as prescribed.  

Performing general maintenance checks requires minimal mechanical skill and only a few general automotive tools.  

# 8-2 Maintenance and do-it-yourself  

These checks or inspections can be done by yourself, a qualified technician or, if you prefer, a NISSAN dealer.  

# WHERE TO GO FOR SERVICE  

If maintenance service is required or your vehicle appears to malfunction, have the systems checked and serviced by a NISSAN dealer.  

NISSAN technicians are well-trained specialists and are kept up-to-date with the latest service information through technical bulletins, service tips, and in-dealership information systems. They are completely qualified to work on NISSAN vehicles before work begins.  

You can be confident that a NISSAN dealer’s service department performs the best job to meet the maintenance requirements on your vehicle.  

During the normal day-to-day operation of the vehicle, general maintenance should be performed regularly as prescribed in this section. If you detect any unusual sounds, vibrations or smell, be sure to check for the cause or have a NISSAN dealer do it promptly. In addition, you should notify a NISSAN dealer if you think that repairs are required.  

When performing any checks or maintenance work, see “Maintenance precautions” (P.8-5).  

# EXPLANATION OF MAINTENANCE ITEMS  

# Additional information on the following items with “\*” is found later in this section.  

Outside the vehicle  

The maintenance items listed here should be performed from time to time, unless otherwise specified.  

Doors and engine hood: Check that all doors and the engine hood operate properly. Also ensure that all latches lock securely. Lubricate hinges, latches, latch pins, rollers and links if necessary. Make sure that the secondary latch keeps the hood from opening when the primary latch is released.  

When driving in areas using road salt or other corrosive materials, check lubrication frequently.  

Lights\*: Clean the headlights on a regular basis. Make sure that the headlights, stop lights, tail lights, turn signal lights, and other lights are all operating properly and installed securely. Also check headlight aim.  

Road wheel nuts (lug nuts)\*: When checking the tires, make sure no wheel nuts are missing, and check for any loose wheel nuts. Tighten if necessary.  

Tire rotation\*: Tires should be rotated every 5,000 miles $(8,000~\mathrm{km})$ .  

Tires\*: Check the pressure with a gauge often and always prior to long distance trips. If necessary, adjust the pressure in all tires, including the spare, to the pressure specified. Check carefully for damage, cuts or excessive wear.  

Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) transmitter components: Replace the TPMS transmitter grommet seal, valve core and cap when the tires are replaced due to wear or age.  

Wheel alignment and balance: If the vehicle should pull to either side while driving on a straight and level road, or if you detect uneven or abnormal tire wear, there may be a need for wheel alignment.  

If the steering wheel or seat vibrates at normal highway speeds, wheel balancing may be needed.  

For additional information regarding tires, refer to “Important Tire Safety Information” (US) or “Tire Safety Information” (Canada) in the Warranty Information Booklet.  

Windshield: Clean the windshield on a regular basis. Check the windshield at least every six months for cracks or other damage. Have a damaged windshield repaired by a qualified repair facility.  

Windshield wiper blades\*: Check for cracks or wear if they do not wipe properly.  

# Inside the vehicle  

The maintenance items listed here should be checked on a regular basis, such as when performing scheduled maintenance, cleaning the vehicle, etc.  

Accelerator pedal: Check the pedal for smooth operation and make sure the pedal does not catch or require uneven effort. Keep the floor mat away from the pedal.  

Brake pedal: Check the pedal for smooth operation. If the brake pedal suddenly goes down further than normal, the pedal feels spongy or the vehicle seems to take longer to stop, see a NISSAN dealer immediately. Keep the floor mat away from the pedal.  

Brakes: Check that the brakes do not pull the vehicle to one side when applied.  

Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) P (Park) position mechanism: On a fairly steep hill, check that the vehicle is held securely with the shift lever in the P (Park) position without applying any brakes.  

Parking brake: Check the parking brake operation regularly. The vehicle should be securely held on a fairly steep hill with only the parking brake applied. If the parking brake needs adjustment, see a NISSAN dealer.  

Seat belts: Check that all parts of the seat belt system (for example, buckles, anchors, adjusters and retractors) operate properly and smoothly, and are installed securely. Check the belt webbing for cuts, fraying, wear or damage.  

Seats: Check seat position controls such as seat adjusters, seatback recliner, etc. to ensure they operate smoothly and that all latches lock securely in every position. Check that the head restraints/headrests move up and down smoothly and that the locks (if so equipped) hold securely in all latched positions.  

Steering wheel: Check for changes in the steering conditions, such as excessive free play, hard steering or strange noises.  

Warning lights and chimes: Make sure that all warning lights and chimes are operating properly.  

Windshield defroster: Check that the air comes out of the defroster outlets properly and in sufficient quantity when operating the heater or air conditioner.  

Windshield wiper and washer\*: Check that the wipers and washer operate properly and that the wipers do not streak.  

Under the hood and vehicle  

The maintenance items listed here should be checked periodically (for example, each time you check the engine oil or refuel).  

Battery\*: Check the fluid level in each cell. It should be between the MAX and MIN lines. Vehicles operated in high temperatures or under severe condition require frequent checks of the battery fluid level.  

# NOTE:  

Care should be taken to avoid situations that can lead to potential battery discharge and potential no-start conditions such as:  

1. Installation or extended use of electronic accessories that consume battery power when the engine is not running (Phone chargers, GPS, DVD players, etc.)   
2. Vehicle is not driven regularly and/or only driven short distances.  

# In these cases, the battery may need to be charged to maintain battery health.  

Brake fluid level\*: Make sure that the brake fluid level is between the MAX and MIN lines on the reservoir.  

Engine coolant level\*: Check the coolant level when the engine is cold.  

Engine drive belts\*: Make sure that the drive belts are not frayed, worn, cracked or oily.  

Engine oil level\*: Check the level after parking the vehicle on a level surface and turning off the engine. Wait more than 10 minutes for the oil to drain back into the oil pan.  

Exhaust system: Make sure there are no loose supports, cracks or holes. If the sound of the exhaust seems unusual or there is a smell of exhaust fumes, immediately have the exhaust system inspected by a NISSAN dealer. (See “Precautions when starting and driving” (P.5-2) for exhaust gas (carbon monoxide).)  

Fluid leaks: Check under the vehicle for fuel, oil, water or other fluid leaks after the vehicle has been parked for a while. Water dripping from the air conditioner after use is normal. If you should notice any leaks or if gasoline fumes are evident, check for the cause and have it corrected immediately.  

Power steering fluid level\* and lines: Check the level when the fluid is cold, with the engine off. Check the lines for proper attachment, leaks, cracks, etc.  

Radiator and hoses: Check the front of the radiator and clean off any dirt, insects, leaves, etc., that may have accumulated. Make sure the hoses have no cracks, deformation, rot or loose connections.  

Underbody: The underbody is frequently exposed to corrosive substances such as those used on icy roads or to control dust. It is very important to remove these substances, otherwise rust will form on the floor pan, frame, fuel lines and around the exhaust system. At the end of winter, the underbody should be thoroughly flushed with plain water, being careful to clean those areas where mud and dirt may accumulate. For additional information, see “Cleaning exterior” (P.7-2).  

Windshield washer fluid\*: Check that there is adequate fluid in the reservoir.  

# MAINTENANCE PRECAUTIONS  

When performing any inspection or maintenance work on your vehicle, always take care to prevent serious accidental injury to yourself or damage to the vehicle. The following are general precautions which should be closely observed.  

# WARNING  

. Park the vehicle on a level surface, apply the parking brake securely and block the wheels to prevent the vehicle from moving. Move the shift lever to P (Park). Be sure the ignition switch is in the OFF or LOCK position when performing any parts replacement or repairs. If you must work with the engine running, keep your hands, clothing, hair and tools away from moving fans, belts and any other moving parts. It is advisable to secure or remove any loose clothing and remove any jewelry, such as rings, watches, etc. before working on your vehicle. Always wear eye protection whenever you work on your vehicle.  

If you must run the engine in an enclosed space such as a garage, be sure there is proper ventilation for exhaust gases to escape.   
Never get under the vehicle while it is supported only by a jack. If it is necessary to work under the vehicle, support it with safety stands.   
Keep smoking materials, flame and sparks away from fuel tank and the battery.   
The fuel filter or fuel lines should be serviced by a NISSAN dealer because the fuel lines are under high pressure even when the engine is off.  

# ！ CAUTION  

Do not work under the hood while the engine is hot. Turn the engine off and wait until it cools down. Avoid direct contact with used engine oil and coolant. Improperly disposed engine oil, and engine coolant and/or other vehicle fluids can damage the environment. Al  

ways conform to local regulations for disposal of vehicle fluid.   
Never leave the engine or the CVT related component harnesses disconnected while the ignition switch is in the ON position.   
Never connect or disconnect the battery or any transistorized component while the ignition switch is in the ON position.   
Your vehicle is equipped with an automatic engine cooling fan. It may come on at any time without warning, even if the ignition key is in the OFF position and the engine is not running. To avoid injury, always disconnect the negative battery cable before working near the fan.  

This “8. Maintenance and do-it-yourself” section gives instructions regarding only those items which are relatively easy for an owner to perform.  

A genuine NISSAN Service Manual is also available. (See “Owner’s manual/service manual order information” (P.9-28).)  

You should be aware that incomplete or improper servicing may result in operating difficulties or excessive emissions, and could affect warranty coverage. If in doubt about any servicing, we recommend that it be done by a NISSAN dealer.

# ENGINE COOLING SYSTEM  

The engine cooling system is filled at the factory with a pre-diluted mixture of $50\%$ Genuine NISSAN Long Life Antifreeze/Coolant (blue) and $50\%$ water to provide year-round anti-freeze and coolant protection. The anti-freeze solution contains rust and corrosion inhibitors. Additional engine cooling system additives are not necessary.  

# WARNING  

Never remove the radiator or coolant reservoir cap when the engine is hot. Wait until the engine and radiator cool down. Serious burns could be caused by high pressure fluid escaping from the radiator. See precautions in “If your vehicle overheats” (P.6-12) of this manual. The radiator is equipped with a pressure type radiator cap. To prevent engine damage, use only a genuine NISSAN radiator cap.  

# ！ CAUTION  

Never use any cooling system additives such as radiator sealer. Additives may clog the cooling system and cause damage to the engine, transmission and/or cooling system. When adding or replacing coolant, be sure to use only Genuine NISSAN Long Life Antifreeze/Coolant (blue) or equivalent. Genuine NISSAN Long Life Antifreeze/Coolant (blue) is pre-diluted to provide antifreeze protection to $-34^{\circ}F$ $(-37^{\circ}\mathbf{C})$ . If additional freeze protection is needed due to weather where you operate your vehicle, add Genuine NISSAN Long Life Antifreeze/ Coolant (blue) concentrate following the directions on the container. If an equivalent coolant other than Genuine NISSAN Long Life Antifreeze/Coolant (blue) is used, follow the coolant manufacture’s instructions to maintain minimum antifreeze protection to $-34^{\circ}F$ $(-37^{\circ}\mathbf{C})$ . The use of other types of coolant solutions other than Genuine NISSAN Long Life Antifreeze/ Coolant (blue) or equivalent may damage the engine cooling system.  

The life expectancy of the factory-fill coolant is 105,000 miles (168,000 km) or 7 years. Mixing any other type of coolant other than Genuine NISSAN Long Life Antifreeze/Coolant (blue) , including Genuine NISSAN Long Life Antifreeze/Coolant (green), or the use of nondistilled water will reduce the life expectancy of the factory-fill coolant. Refer to the NISSAN Service and Maintenance Guide for more details.

To fill the window washer fluid reservoir, lift the cap and pour the window washer fluid into the reservoir opening.  

Add a washer solvent to the water for better cleaning. In the winter season, add a windshield washer antifreeze. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the mixture ratio.  

Refill the reservoir more frequently when driving conditions require an increased amount of window washer fluid.  

Recommended fluid:  

Genuine NISSAN Windshield Washer Concentrate Cleaner & Antifreeze or equivalent  

# CAUTION  

Do not substitute engine anti-freeze coolant for window washer solution. This may result in damage to the paint.   
Do not fill the window washer reservoir tank with washer fluid concentrates at full strength. Some methyl alcohol based washer fluid concentrates may permanently stain the grille if spilled while filling the window washer reservoir tank.   
Pre-mix washer fluid concentrates with water to the manufacturer’s recommended levels before pouring the fluid into the window washer reservoir tank. Do not use the window washer reservoir tank to mix the washer fluid concentrate and water.  

# BATTERY  

Keep the battery surface clean and dry. Clean the battery with a solution of baking soda and water. Make certain the terminal connections are clean and securely tightened. If the vehicle is not to be used for 30 days or longer, disconnect the negative $(-)$ battery terminal cable to prevent discharging it.  

# NOTE:  

Care should be taken to avoid situations that can lead to potential battery discharge and potential no-start conditions such as:  

1. Installation or extended use of electronic accessories that consume battery power when the engine is not running (Phone chargers, GPS, DVD players, etc.)   
2. Vehicle is not driven regularly and/or only driven short distances.  

In these cases, the battery may need to be charged to maintain battery health.  

# WARNING

# WHEELS AND TIRES  

# If you have a flat tire, see “Flat tire” (P.6-3). TIRE PRESSURE  

Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) This vehicle is equipped with the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS). It monitors tire pressure of all tires except the spare. When the low tire pressure warning light is lit and the CHECK TIRE PRESSURE warning appears on the vehicle information display, one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated.  

The TPMS will activate only when the vehicle is driven at speeds above 16 MPH $\left(25\mathrm{km/h}\right)$ . Also, this system may not detect a sudden drop in tire pressure (for example a flat tire while driving).  

For more details, see “Low tire pressure warning light” (P.2-14), “Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)” (P.5-3) and “Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)” (P.6-3).  

# Tire inflation pressure  

Check the pressure of the tires (including the spare) often and always prior to long distance trips. The recommended tire pressure specifications are shown on the Tire and Loading Information label under the “Cold Tire Pressure” heading. The Tire and Loading Information label is affixed to  

# 8-30 Maintenance and do-it-yourself  

the driver side center pillar. Tire pressures should be checked regularly because:  

. Most tires naturally lose air over time. Tires can lose air suddenly when driven over potholes or other objects or if the vehicle strikes a curb while parking.  

The tire pressures should be checked when the tires are cold. The tires are considered COLD after the vehicle has been parked for 3 or more hours, or driven less than 1 mile $(1.6~\ k m)$ at moderate speeds.  

The TPMS with Easy Fill Tire Alert provides visual and audible signals outside the vehicle for inflating the tires to the recommended COLD tire pressure. (See “TPMS with Easy Fill Tire Alert” (P.5-6).)  

Incorrect tire pressure, including under inflation, may adversely affect tire life and vehicle handling.  

# WARNING  

Improperly inflated tires can fail suddenly and cause an accident.  

The Gross Vehicle Weight rating (GVWR) is located on the F.M.V. S.S./C.M.V.S.S. certification label. The vehicle weight capacity is indicated on the Tire and Loading Information label. Do not load your vehicle beyond this capacity. Overloading your vehicle may result in reduced tire life, unsafe operating conditions due to premature tire failure, or unfavorable handling characteristics and could also lead to a serious accident. Loading beyond the specified capacity may also result in failure of other vehicle components. Before taking a long trip, or whenever you heavily load your vehicle, use a tire pressure gauge to ensure that the tire pressures are at the specified level. For additional information regarding tires, refer to “Important Tire Safety Information” (US) or “Tire Safety Information” (Canada) in the Warranty Information Booklet.

Checking the tire pressure  

1. Remove the valve stem cap from the tire.  

2. Press the pressure gauge squarely onto the valve stem. Do not press too hard or force the valve stem sideways, or air will escape. If the hissing sound of air escaping from the tire is heard while checking the pressure, reposition the gauge to eliminate this leakage.  

3. Remove the gauge.  

4. Read the tire pressure on the gauge stem and compare it to the specification shown on the Tire and Loading Information label.  

5. Add air to the tire as needed. If too much air is added, press the core of the valve stem briefly with the tip of the gauge stem to release pressure. Recheck the pressure and add or release air as needed.   
6. Install the valve stem cap.   
7. Check the pressure of all other tires, including the spare.

# TIRE LABELING  

Federal law requires tire manufacturers to place standardized information on the sidewall of all tires. This information identifies and describes the fundamental characteristics of the tire and also provides the tire identification number (TIN) for safety standard certification. The TIN can be used to identify the tire in case of a recall.  

![](images/4c24efa111907e12feab3c9b600c2ba1df392380b67354ff44c5f683b92d3c08.jpg)  
Example  

$\textcircled{1}$ Tire size (example: P215/60R16 94H)  

1. P: The “P” indicates the tire is designed for passenger vehicles. (Not all tires have this information.)   
2. Three-digit number (215): This number gives the width in millimeters of the tire from sidewall edge to sidewall edge.   
3. Two-digit number (60): This number, known as the aspect ratio, gives the tire’s ratio of height to width.   
4. R: The “R” stands for radial.  

5. Two-digit number (16): This number is the wheel or rim diameter in inches.  

6. Two- or three-digit number (94): This number is the tire’s load index. It is a measurement of how much weight each tire can support. You may not find this information on all tires because it is not required by law.  

7. H: Tire speed rating. You should not drive the vehicle faster than the tire speed rating.

$\textcircled{6}$ Term of “tubeless” or “tube type” Indicates whether the tire requires an inner tube (“tube type”) or not (“tubeless”).  

$\textcircled{7}$ The word “radial”  

The word “radial” is shown, if the tire has radial structure.  

$\textcircled{8}$ Manufacturer or brand name  

Manufacturer or brand name is shown.  

# Other tire-related terminology:  

In addition to the many terms that are defined throughout this section, Intended Outboard Sidewall is (1) the sidewall that contains a whitewall, bears white lettering or bears manufacturer, brand and/or model name molding that is higher or deeper than the same molding on the other sidewall of the tire, or (2) the outward facing sidewall of an asymmetrical tire that has a particular side that must always face outward when mounted on a vehicle.  

# TYPES OF TIRES  

# WARNING  

When changing or replacing tires, be sure all four tires are of the same type (Example: Summer, All Season or Snow) and construction. A NISSAN dealer may be able to help you with information about tire type, size, speed rating and availability. Replacement tires may have a lower speed rating than the factory equipped tires, and may not match the potential maximum vehicle speed. Never exceed the maximum speed rating of the tire. Replacing tires with those not originally specified by NISSAN could affect the proper operation of the TPMS. For additional information regarding tires, refer to “Important Tire Safety Information” (US) or “Tire Safety Information” (Canada) in the Warranty Information Booklet.  

# All season tires  

NISSAN specifies all season tires on some models to provide good performance all year, including snowy and icy road conditions. All Season tires are identified by ALL SEASON and/or M&S (Mud and Snow) on the tire sidewall. Snow tires have better snow traction than All Season tires and may be more appropriate in some areas.  

# Summer tires  

NISSAN specifies summer tires on some models to provide superior performance on dry roads. Summer tire performance is substantially reduced in snow and ice. Summer tires do not have the tire traction rating M&S on the tire sidewall.  

If you plan to operate your vehicle in snowy or icy conditions, NISSAN recommends the use of SNOW tires or ALL SEASON tires on all four wheels.  

# Snow tires  

If snow tires are needed, it is necessary to select tires equivalent in size and load rating to the original equipment tires. If you do not, it can adversely affect the safety and handling of your vehicle.  

Generally, snow tires will have lower speed ratings than factory equipped tires and may not match the potential maximum vehicle speed. Never exceed the maximum speed rating of the tire.  

If you install snow tires, they must be the same size, brand, construction and tread pattern on all four wheels.  

For additional traction on icy roads, studded tires may be used. However, some U.S. states and Canadian provinces prohibit their use. Check local, state and provincial laws before installing studded tires. Skid and traction capabilities of studded snow tires, on wet or dry surfaces, may be poorer than that of nonstudded snow tires.  

# TIRE CHAINS  

# ! CAUTION  

NISSAN recommends using the following tire cables made by Peerless Chain Company on P235/55R18 size tire due to limited tire clearance. Call 800-533-8056 to order tire chains for your vehicle. — P235/55R18 - Peerless Chain part number SC1040 Failure to use the correct traction device will cause damage to the brakes, suspension or other vehicle parts. Or, you should install P225/65R16 size tire on your vehicle. Only certain SAE class “S” tire chains can be used on this vehicle. Using the wrong Class “S” chains on this vehicle will cause damage to the vehicle. If you plan to use tire chains/cables, you should use a tire chain that meets the minimum clearances for your vehicle.  

Use of tire chains may be prohibited according to location. Check the local laws before installing tire chains. When installing tire chains, make sure they are the proper size for the tires on your vehicle and are installed according to the chain manufacturer’s suggestions.  

For 18-inch size tire, the tire chain part number and Peerless Chain Company phone number are correct at the time of printing that is shown on the back cover of this Owner’s Manual. Always confirm the correct part numbers with Peerless Chain Company before ordering. Only use other types of traction devices if the traction device manufacturer recommends it for use on your specific vehicle and the tire and wheel installed on your vehicle.  

![](images/d7aaea4adec52a5fbda944297e73a668907031ef9235af5ca8e2f5125af99b7d.jpg)  
16-inch size tire  

For 16-inch size tire, use a tire chain that is designed to provide the specified space $\textcircled{4}$ between the installed tire chain $\textcircled{1}$ and where the tire meets the rim $\textcircled{2}$ as shown on the chart.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Wheel size</td><td>Minimum space required</td></tr><tr><td>16 in</td><td>1.8 in n (44 mm)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

A tire chain that provides the specified amount of space will provide the necessary clearance between the tire and the closest vehicle suspension or body component. The minimum clearances are determined using the factoryequipped tires. Other types may damage your vehicle. Use chain tensioners when recommended by the tire chain manufacturer to ensure a tight fit. Loose end links of the tire chain must be secured or removed to prevent the possibility of whipping action damage to the fenders or underbody. If possible, avoid fully loading your vehicle when using tire chains. In addition, drive at a reduced speed. Otherwise, your vehicle may be damaged and/or vehicle handling and performance may be adversely affected.  

# Tire chains must be installed only on the front wheels and not on the rear wheels.  

Never install tire chains on a TEMPORARY USE ONLY spare tire.  

Do not use tire chains on dry roads. Driving with tire chains in such conditions can cause damage to the various mechanisms of the vehicle due to some overstress.  

![](images/6ac6b55ab1d1fb1f5e67e040908b7b6a678f195a3ca8cd2f8465975b8d88b65b.jpg)  

# CHANGING WHEELS AND TIRES  

# Tire rotation  

NISSAN recommends rotating the tires every 5,000 miles $(8,000~\mathrm{km})$ . (See “Flat tire” (P.6-3) for tire replacing procedures.) As soon as possible, tighten the wheel nuts to the specified torque with a torque wrench.  

Wheel nut tightening torque: 80 ft-lb (108 N·m)  

The wheel nuts must be kept tightened to the specification at all times.  

It is recommended that wheel nuts be tightened to the specification at each tire rotation interval.  

# WARNING  

After rotating the tires, check and adjust the tire pressure.   
Retighten the wheel nuts when the vehicle has been driven for 600 miles $(1,000~\mathrm{km})$ (also in cases of a flat tire, etc.).   
Do not include the spare tire or any other small size spare tire in the tire rotation.   
For additional information regarding tires, refer to “Important Tire Safety Information” (US) or “Tire Safety Information” (Canada) in the Warranty Information Booklet.  

![](images/6437d294ac2d702707292fb7c9d039305ca73d8d5657d918c2f08bc1ded1e58d.jpg)  

Tire wear and damage 1. Wear indicator 2. Wear indicator location mark  

# WARNING  

Tires should be periodically inspected for wear, cracking, bulging or objects caught in the tread. If excessive wear, cracks, bulging or deep cuts are found, the tire(s) should be replaced.  

The original tires have built-in tread wear indicators. When wear indicators are visible, the tire(s) should be replaced.   
Tires degrade with age and use. Have tires, including the spare, over 6 years old checked by a qualified technician, because some tire damage may not be obvious. Replace the tires as necessary to prevent tire failure and possible personal injury. Improper service of the spare tire may result in serious personal injury. If it is necessary to repair the spare tire, contact a NISSAN dealer.   
For additional information regarding tires, refer to “Important Tire Safety Information” (US) or “Tire Safety Information” (Canada) in the Warranty Information Booklet.  

# Replacing wheels and tires  

When replacing a tire, use the same size, tread design, speed rating and load carrying capacity as originally equipped. (See “Specifications” (P.9-7) for recommended types and sizes of tires and wheels.)  

# WARNING  

. The use of tires other than those recommended or the mixed use of tires of different brands, construction (bias, bias-belted or radial), or tread patterns can adversely affect the ride, braking, handling, ground clearance, body-to-tire clearance, tire chain clearance, speedometer calibration, headlight aim and bumper height. Some of these effects may lead to accidents and could result in serious personal injury. If your vehicle was originally equipped with 4 tires that were the same size and you are only replacing 2 of the 4 tires, install the new tires on the rear axle. Placing new tires on the front axle may cause loss of vehicle control in some driving conditions and cause an accident and personal injury.  

If the wheels are changed for any reason, always replace with wheels which have the same off-set dimension. Wheels of a different off-set could cause premature tire wear, degrade vehicle handling characteristics and/or interference with the brake discs/drums. Such interference can lead to decreased braking efficiency and/or early brake pad/ shoe wear. See “Wheels and tires” (P.9-7) of this manual for wheel offset dimensions.   
When a spare tire is mounted or a wheel is replaced, the TPMS will not function and the low tire pressure warning light will flash for approximately 1 minute. The light will remain on after 1 minute. Contact your NISSAN dealer as soon as possible for tire replacement and/ or system resetting.   
Replacing tires with those not originally specified by NISSAN could affect the proper operation of the TPMS.   
Do not install a damaged or deformed wheel or tire even if it has  

been repaired. Such wheels or tires could have structural damage and could fail without warning. The use of retread tire is not recommended. For additional information regarding tires, refer to “Important Tire Safety Information” (US) or “Tire Safety Information” (Canada) in the Warranty Information Booklet.  

# Wheel balance  

Unbalanced wheels may affect vehicle handling and tire life. Even with regular use, wheels can get out of balance. Therefore, they should be balanced as required.  

Wheel balance service should be performed with the wheels off the vehicle. Spin balancing the wheels on the vehicle could lead to mechanical damage.  

For additional information regarding tires, refer to “Important Tire Safety Information” (US) or “Tire Safety Information” (Canada) in the Warranty Information Booklet.  

# Care of wheels  

See “Cleaning exterior” (P.7-2) for details about care of the wheels.  

# Spare tire  

When a spare tire is mounted (TEMPORARY USE ONLY or conventional), the TPMS will not function.  

Observe the following precautions if the TEMPORARY USE ONLY spare tire must be used, otherwise your vehicle could be damaged or involved in an accident.  

# WARNING  

The TEMPORARY USE ONLY spare tire should be used for emergency use. It should be replaced with the standard tire at the first opportunity to avoid possible tire or differential damage. Drive carefully while the TEMPORARY USE ONLY spare tire is installed. Avoid sharp turns and abrupt braking while driving. Periodically check spare tire inflation pressure. Always keep the pressure of the TEMPORARY USE ONLY spare tire at 60 psi $(420~\mathsf{k P a},$ ,  

4.2 bar). Always keep the pressure of the full size spare tire (if so equipped) at the recommended pressure for standard tires, as indicated on the Tire and Loading Information label.   
With the TEMPORARY USE ONLY spare tire installed do not drive your vehicle at speeds faster than 50 MPH $\mathbf{(80km/h)}$ .   
When driving on roads covered with snow or ice, the TEMPORARY USE ONLY spare tire should be used on the rear wheels and original tire used on the front wheels (drive wheels). Use tire chains only on the front (original) tires.   
Tire tread of the TEMPORARY USE ONLY spare tire will wear at a faster rate than the standard tire. Replace the spare tire as soon as the tread wear indicators appear.   
Do not use the spare tire on other vehicles.   
Do not use more than one spare tire at the same time.   
Do not tow a trailer while the TEMPORARY USE ONLY spare tire  

is installed.  

# ! CAUTION  

Do not use tire chains on a TEMPORARY USE ONLY spare tire. Tire chains will not fit properly and may cause damage to the vehicle. Because the TEMPORARY USE ONLY spare tire is smaller than the original tire, ground clearance is reduced. To avoid damage to the vehicle, do not drive over obstacles. Also do not drive the vehicle through an automatic car wash since it may get caught.

# FUEL INFORMATION  

Use unleaded regular gasoline with an octane rating of at least 87 AKI (Anti-Knock Index) number (Research octane number 91).  

# CAUTION  

Using a fuel other than that specified could adversely affect the emission control system, and may also affect warranty coverage.   
Under no circumstances should a leaded gasoline be used, because this will damage the three-way catalyst.   
Do not use E-15 or E-85 fuel in your vehicle. Your vehicle is not designed to run on E-15 or E-85 fuel. Using E15 or E-85 fuel in a vehicle not specifically designed for E-15 or E85 fuel can adversely affect the emission control devices and systems of the vehicle. Damage caused by such fuel is not covered by the NISSAN new vehicle limited warranty.   
U.S. government regulations require  

ethanol dispensing pumps to be  

# identified by a small, square, orange and black label with the common abbreviation or the appropriate percentage for that region.  

# Gasoline specifications  

NISSAN recommends using gasoline that meets the World-Wide Fuel Charter (WWFC) specifications where it is available. Many of the automobile manufacturers developed this specification to improve emission control system and vehicle performance. Ask your service station manager if the gasoline meets the WWFC specifications.  

# Reformulated gasoline  

Some fuel suppliers are now producing reformulated gasolines. These gasolines are specially designed to reduce vehicle emissions. NISSAN supports efforts towards cleaner air and suggests that you use reformulated gasoline when available.  

# Gasoline containing oxygenates  

Some fuel suppliers sell gasoline containing oxygenates such as ethanol, MTBE and methanol with or without advertising their presence. NISSAN does not recommend the use of fuels of which the oxygenate content and the fuel compatibility for your NISSAN cannot be readily determined. If in doubt, ask your service station manager.  

If you use oxygenate-blend gasoline, please take the following precautions as the usage of such fuels may cause vehicle performance problems and/or fuel system damage.  

The fuel should be unleaded and have an octane rating no lower than that recommended for unleaded gasoline. If an oxygenate-blend, other than methanol blend is used, it should contain no more than $10\%$ oxygenate. (MTBE may, however, be added up to $15\%$ )   
E-15 fuel contains more than $10\%$ oxygenate. E-15 fuel will adversely affect the emission control devices and systems of the vehicle and should not be used. Damage caused by such fuel is not covered by the NISSAN new vehicle limited warranty.   
If a methanol blend is used, it should contain no more than $5\%$ methanol (methyl alcohol, wood alcohol). It should also contain a suitable amount of appropriate cosolvents and corrosion inhibitors. If not properly formulated with appropriate cosolvents and corrosion inhibitors, such methanol  

blends may cause fuel system damage and/or vehicle performance problems. At this time, sufficient data is not available to ensure that all methanol blends are suitable for use in NISSAN vehicles.  

If any driveability problems such as engine stalling and difficult hot-starting are experienced after using oxygenate-blend fuels, immediately change to a non-oxygenate fuel or a fuel with a low blend of MTBE.  

# Take care not to spill gasoline during refueling. Gasoline containing oxygenates can cause paint damage.  

# E-15 fuel  

E-15 fuel is a mixture of approximately $15\%$ fuel ethanol and $85\%$ unleaded gasoline. E-15 can only be used in vehicles designed to run on E15 fuel. Do not use E-15 in your vehicle. U.S. government regulations require fuel ethanol dispensing pumps to be identified with small, square, orange and black label with the common abbreviation or the appropriate percentage for that region.  

# E-85 fuel  

E-85 fuel is a mixture of approximately $85\%$ fuel ethanol and $15\%$ unleaded gasoline. E-85 can only be used in a Flexible Fuel Vehicle (FFV). Do not use E-85 fuel in your vehicle. U.S. government regulations require fuel ethanol dispensing pumps to be identified by a small, square, orange and black label with the common abbreviation or the appropriate percentage for that region.  

# Aftermarket fuel additives  

NISSAN does not recommend the use of any aftermarket fuel additives (for example, fuel injector cleaner, octane booster, intake valve deposit removers, etc.) which are sold commercially. Many of these additives intended for gum, varnish or deposit removal may contain active solvent or similar ingredients that can be harmful to the fuel system and engine.  

# Octane rating tips  

Using unleaded gasoline with an octane rating lower than recommended can cause persistent, heavy “spark knock”. (Spark knock is a metallic rapping noise.) If severe, this can lead to engine damage. If you detect a persistent heavy spark knock even when using gasoline of the stated octane rating, or if you hear steady spark knock while holding a steady speed on level roads, have a NISSAN dealer correct the condition. Failure to correct the condition is misuse of the vehicle, for which NISSAN is not responsible.  

Incorrect ignition timing will result in spark knock, after-run and/or overheating, which may cause excessive fuel consumption or engine damage. If any of the above symptoms are encountered, have your vehicle checked at a NISSAN dealer.  

However, now and then you may notice light spark knock for a short time while accelerating or driving up hills. This is not a cause for concern, because you get the greatest fuel benefit when there is light spark knock for a short time under heavy engine load.

# ENGINE OIL AND OIL FILTER RECOMMENDATION  

# Selecting the correct oil  

It is essential to choose the correct grade, quality, and viscosity engine oil to ensure satisfactory engine life and performance, see “Capacities and recommended fluids/lubricants” (P.9-2). NISSAN recommends the use of an energy conserving oil in order to improve fuel economy.  

Select only engine oils that meet the American Petroleum Institute (API) certification or International Lubricant Standardization and Approval Committee (ILSAC) certification and SAE viscosity standard. These oils have the API certification mark on the front of the container. Oils which do not have the specified quality label should not be used as they could cause engine damage.  

# Oil additives  

NISSAN does not recommend the use of oil additives. The use of an oil additive is not necessary when the proper oil type is used and maintenance intervals are followed.  

Oil which may contain foreign matter or has been previously used should not be used.  

# Oil viscosity  

The engine oil viscosity or thickness changes with temperature. Because of this, it is important to select the engine oil viscosity based on the temperatures at which the vehicle will be operated before the next oil change. Choosing an oil viscosity other than that recommended could cause serious engine damage.  

# Selecting the correct oil filter  

Your new NISSAN vehicle is equipped with a high-quality genuine NISSAN oil filter. When replacing, use a genuine NISSAN oil filter or its equivalent for the reason described in “Change intervals”.  

# Change intervals  

The oil and oil filter change intervals for your engine are based on the use of the specified quality oils and filters. Using an engine oil and filter other than the specified quality, or exceeding recommended oil and filter change intervals could reduce engine life. Damage to the engine caused by improper maintenance or use of incorrect oil and filter quality and/or viscosity is not covered by the NISSAN new vehicle limited warranty.  

Your engine was filled with a high quality engine oil when it was built. You do not have to change the oil before the first recommended change interval. Oil and filter change intervals depend upon how you use your vehicle.  

Operation under the following conditions may require more frequent oil and filter changes.  

repeated short distance driving at cold outside temperatures . driving in dusty conditions . extensive idling . towing a trailer . stop and go commuting  

Refer to the “NISSAN Service and Maintenance Guide” for the maintenance schedule.  

# AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM REFRIGERANT AND LUBRICANT RECOMMENDATIONS  

The air conditioning system in your NISSAN vehicle must be charged with the refrigerant HFC-134a (R-134a) and the oil, NISSAN A/C system oil Type S or the exact equivalents.  

# CAUTION  

The use of any other refrigerant or oil will cause severe damage to the air conditioning system and will require the replacement of all air conditioner  

# 9-6 Technical and consumer information  

# system components.  

The refrigerant HFC-134a (R-134a) in your NISSAN vehicle will not harm the earth’s ozone layer. Although this refrigerant does not affect the earth’s atmosphere, certain governmental regulations require the recovery and recycling of any refrigerant during automotive air conditioning system service. A NISSAN dealer has the trained technicians and equipment needed to recover and recycle your air conditioning system refrigerant.  

Contact a NISSAN dealer when servicing your air conditioning system.

# WHEN TRAVELING OR REGISTERING YOUR VEHICLE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY  

When planning to travel in another country, you should first find out if the fuel available is suitable for your vehicle’s engine.  

Using fuel with an octane rating that is too low may cause engine damage. All gasoline vehicles must be operated with unleaded gasoline. Therefore, avoid taking your vehicle to areas where appropriate fuel is not available.  

When transferring the registration of your vehicle to another country, state, province or district, it may be necessary to modify the vehicle to meet local laws and regulations.  

The laws and regulations for motor vehicle emission control and safety standards vary according to the country, state, province or district; therefore, vehicle specifications may differ.  

When any vehicle is to be taken into another country, state, province or district and registered, its modifications, transportation, and registration are the responsibility of the user. NISSAN is not responsible for any inconvenience that may result.

# VEHICLE LOADING INFORMATION  

# WARNING  

It is extremely dangerous to ride in a cargo area inside the vehicle. In a collision, people riding in these areas are more likely to be seriously injured or killed. Do not allow people to ride in any area of your vehicle that is not equipped with seats and seat belts.   
Be sure everyone in your vehicle is in a seat and using a seat belt properly.  

# TERMS  

It is important to familiarize yourself with the following terms before loading your vehicle:  

Curb Weight (actual weight of your vehicle) - vehicle weight including: standard and optional equipment, fluids, emergency tools, and spare tire assembly. This weight does not include passengers and cargo.  

GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight) - curb weight plus the combined weight of passengers and cargo.   
GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) - maximum total combined weight of the unloaded vehicle, passengers, luggage, hitch, trailer tongue load and any other optional equipment. This information is located on the F.M.V.S.S./C.M.V.S.S. label.   
GAWR (Gross Axle Weight Rating) - maximum weight (load) limit specified for the front or rear axle. This information is located on the F.M.V.S.S./C.M.V. S.S. label.   
GCWR (Gross Combined Weight Rating) - The maximum total weight rating of the vehicle, passengers, cargo, and trailer.   
Vehicle Capacity Weight, Load limit, Total load capacity - maximum total weight limit specified of the load (passengers and cargo) for the vehicle. This is the maximum combined weight of occupants and cargo that can be loaded into the vehicle. If the vehicle is used to tow a trailer, the trailer tongue weight must be included as part of the cargo load. This information is located on the Tire and Loading Information label.   
Cargo capacity - permissible weight of cargo, the subtracted weight of occupants from the load limit.  

# VEHICLE LOAD CAPACITY  

Do not exceed the load limit of your vehicle shown as “The combined weight of occupants and cargo” on the Tire and Loading Information label. Do not exceed the number of occupants shown as “Seating Capacity” on the Tire and Loading Information label.  

To get “the combined weight of occupants and cargo”, add the weight of all occupants, then add the total luggage weight. Examples are shown in the following illustration.  

Example  

Steps for determining correct load limit  

![](images/cdebf8ea13282c53641e4a51e8865324fd4d3658051ba6f66da54c4de75d639c.jpg)  

1. Locate the statement “The combined weight of occupants and cargo should never exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs” on your vehicle’s placard.   
2. Determine the combined weight of the driver and passengers that will be riding in your vehicle.   
3. Subtract the combined weight of the driver and passengers from XXX kg or XXX lbs.   
4. The resulting figure equals the available amount of cargo and luggage load capacity. For example, if the XXX amount equals 1400 lbs. and there will be five 150 lb. passengers in your vehicle, the amount of available cargo and luggage load capacity is 650 lbs. (1400 − 750 $(5\times150)=650$ lbs) or (640 − 340 $(5\times70)=300\mathrm{kg.}$  

5. Determine the combined weight of luggage and cargo being loaded on the vehicle. That weight may not safely exceed the available cargo and luggage load capacity calculated in Step 4.  

6. If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from your trailer will be transferred to your vehicle. Consult this manual to determine how this reduces the available cargo and luggage load capacity of your vehicle.  

Before driving a loaded vehicle, confirm that you do not exceed the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) or the Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) for your vehicle. (See “Measurement of weights” (P.9-15).) Also check tires for proper inflation pressures. See the Tire and Loading Information label.  

![](images/073c41f32df674bf48b2166c2506b318acae7457ab2972a19a3e002df8affb99.jpg)  

# SECURING THE LOAD  

There are tie down hooks located in the cargo area as shown. The tie down hooks can be used to secure cargo with ropes or other types of straps.  

Do not apply a total load of more than 7 lb. $(\mathfrak{s k g})$ to a single hook when securing cargo.  

# WARNING  

Properly secure all cargo with ropes or straps to help prevent it from sliding or shifting. Do not place cargo higher than the seatbacks. In a sudden stop or collision, unsecured cargo could cause personal injury.  

The child restraint top tether strap may be damaged by contact with items in the cargo area. Secure any items in the cargo area. Your child could be seriously injured or killed in a collision if the top tether strap is damaged. Do not load your vehicle any heavier than the GVWR or the maximum front and rear GAWRs. If you do, parts of your vehicle can break, tire damage could occur, or it can change the way your vehicle handles. This could result in loss of control and cause personal injury.  

# LOADING TIPS  

The GVW must not exceed GVWR or GAWR as specified on the F.M.V.S.S./ C.M.V.S.S. certification label. Do not load the front and rear axle to the GAWR. Doing so will exceed the GVWR.  

# WARNING  

Properly secure all cargo with ropes or straps to help prevent it from sliding or shifting. Do not place cargo higher than the seatbacks. In a sudden stop or collision, unsecured cargo could cause personal injury.  

Do not load your vehicle any heavier than the GVWR or the maximum front and rear GAWRs. If you do, parts of your vehicle can break, tire damage could occur, or it can change the way your vehicle handles. This could result in loss of control and cause personal injury. Overloading not only can shorten the life of your vehicle and the tire, but can cause unsafe vehicle handling and longer braking distances. This may cause a premature tire failure, which could result in a serious accident and personal injury.  

# Failures caused by overloading are not covered by the vehicle’s warranty.  

# MEASUREMENT OF WEIGHTS  

Secure loose items to prevent weight shifts that could affect the balance of your vehicle. When the vehicle is loaded, drive to a scale and weigh the front and the rear wheels separately to determine axle loads. Individual axle loads should not exceed either of the Gross Axle Weight Ratings (GAWR). The total of the axle loads should not exceed the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR). These ratings are given on the vehicle certification label. If weight ratings are exceeded, move or remove items to bring all weights below the ratings.  

# TOWING A TRAILER  

# WARNING  

Overloading or improper loading of a trailer and its cargo can adversely affect vehicle handling, braking and performance and may lead to accidents.  

# CAUTION  

Do not tow a trailer or haul a heavy load for the first 500 miles $(800~\mathrm{km})$ . Your engine, axle or other parts could be damaged. For the first 500 miles $(800~\mathrm{km})$ that you tow a trailer, do not drive over 50 MPH $\mathbf{(80km/h)}$ and do not make starts at full throttle. This helps the engine and other parts of your vehicle wear in at the heavier loads.  

Your new vehicle was designed to be used primarily to carry passengers and cargo. Remember that towing a trailer places additional loads on your vehicle’s engine, drivetrain, steering, braking and other systems.  

A NISSAN Towing Guide (U.S. only) is available on the website at www.nissanusa.com. This guide includes information on trailer towing capability and the special equipment required for proper towing.  

# MAXIMUM LOAD LIMITS  

# Maximum trailer loads  

Never allow the total trailer load to exceed the value specified in the “Towing Load/Specification” chart. The total trailer load equals trailer weight plus its cargo weight.  

# When towing a trailer load of 1,000 lbs $(454~\mathsf{k g})$ or more, trailers with a brake system MUST be used.  

The maximum GCWR (Gross Combined Weight Rating) should not exceed the value specified in the following “Towing Load/Specification” chart.  

![](images/919a08a95574526d1468dba5e038bb78d0d3388086ad67077428c90ab80428d4.jpg)  

The GCWR equals the combined weight of the towing vehicle (including passengers and cargo) plus the total trailer load. Towing loads greater than these or using improper towing equipment could adversely affect vehicle handling, braking and performance.  

The ability of your vehicle to tow a trailer is not only related to the maximum trailer loads, but also the places you plan to tow. Tow weights appropriate for level highway driving may have to be reduced on very steep grades or for low traction situations (for example, on slippery boat ramps).  

Temperature conditions can also affect towing. For example, towing a heavy trailer in high outside temperatures on graded roads can affect engine performance and cause overheating. The transmission high fluid temperature protection mode, which helps reduce the chance of transmission damage, could activate and automatically decrease engine power. Vehicle speed may decrease under high load. Plan your trip carefully to account for trailer and vehicle load, weather and road conditions.  

# WARNING  

Overheating can result in reduced engine power and vehicle speed. The reduced speed may be lower than other traffic, which could increase the chance of a collision. Be especially careful when driving. If the vehicle cannot maintain a safe driving speed, pull to the side of the road in a safe area. Allow the engine to cool and return to normal operation. See “If your vehicle overheats” (P.6-12) of this manual.  

# ! CAUTION  

Vehicle damage resulting from improper towing procedures are not covered  

![](images/b52030cc1f6050a512353170270a14c5b2b0602481c218d621772fa10e3df850.jpg)  

# Tongue load  

When using a weight carrying or a weight distributing hitch, keep the tongue load between 10 to $15\%$ of the total trailer load within the maximum tongue load limits shown in the following “Towing Load/Specification” chart. If the tongue load becomes excessive, rearrange cargo to allow for proper tongue load.  

![](images/4427830c92ff5f00b72b58e810d5715962fb14109c4625c0ded369107325af85.jpg)  

# MAXIMUM GROSS VEHICLE WEIGHT(GVW)/MAXIMUM GROSS AXLEWEIGHT (GAW)  

The GVW of the towing vehicle must not exceed the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) shown on the F.M.V.S.S./C.M.V.S.S. certification label. The GVW equals the combined weight of the unloaded vehicle, passengers, luggage, hitch, trailer tongue load and any other optional equipment. In addition, front or rear GAW must not exceed the Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) shown on the F.M.V.S.S./C.M.V.S.S. certification label.  

Towing capacities are calculated assuming a base vehicle with driver and any options required to achieve the rating. Additional passengers, cargo and/or optional equipment, such as the trailer hitch, will add weight to the vehicle and reduce your vehicle’s maximum towing capacity and trailer tongue load.  

The vehicle and trailer need to be weighed to confirm the vehicle is within the GVWR, Front GAWR, Rear GAWR, Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR) and Towing capacity.  

All vehicle and trailer weights can be measured using platform type scales commonly found at truck stops, highway weigh stations, building supply centers or salvage yards.  

To determine the available payload capacity for tongue load, use the following procedure.  

1. Locate the GVWR on the F.M.V.S.S./C.M.V. S.S. certification label.   
2. Weigh your vehicle on the scale with all of the passengers and cargo that are normally in the vehicle when towing a trailer.   
3. Subtract the actual vehicle weight from the GVWR. The remaining amount is the available maximum tongue load.  

To determine the available towing capacity, use the following procedure.  

1. Find the GCWR for your vehicle on the “Towing Load/Specification” chart found later in this section.  

2. Subtract the actual vehicle weight from the GCWR. The remaining amount is the available maximum towing capacity.  

To determine the Gross Trailer Weight, weigh your trailer on a scale with all equipment and cargo, that are normally in the trailer when it is towed. Make sure the Gross trailer weight is not more than the Gross Trailer Weight Rating shown on the trailer and is not more than the calculated available maximum towing capacity.  

Also weigh the front and rear axles on the scale to make sure the Front Gross Axle Weight and Rear Gross Axle Weight are not more than Front Gross Axle Weight and Rear Gross Axle Weight on the F.M.V.S.S./C.M.V.S.S. certification label. The cargo in the trailer and vehicle may need to be moved or removed to meet the specified ratings.  

# Example:  

Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) as weighed on a scale - including passengers, cargo and hitch - 5,520 lb. $(2,503~\mathsf{k g})$ .   
Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) from F.M.V.S.S./C.M.V.S.S. certification label - 5,818 lb. $(2,639~\mathsf{k g})$ .   
Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR) from “Towing Load/Specification” chart - 8,500 lb. $(3,856~\mathsf{k g})$ .  

Maximum Trailer towing capacity from “Towing Load/Specification” chart - 3,500 lb. $(1,588~\mathsf{k g})$ .

$=10~\%$ tongue weight  

The available towing capacity may be less than the maximum towing capacity due to the passenger and cargo load in the vehicle.  

Remember to keep trailer tongue weight between 10 to $15\%$ of the trailer weight. If the tongue load becomes excessive, rearrange the cargo to obtain the proper tongue load. Do not exceed the 10 to $15\%$ tongue weight specification even if the calculated available tongue weight is greater than $15\%$ . If the calculated tongue weight is less than $10\%$ , reduce the total trailer weight to match the available tongue weight.  

Always verify that available capacities are within the required ratings.

1: All towing above 1,000 lb $(454~\mathsf{k g})$ requires the use of trailer brakes. NISSAN recommends the use of a tandem axle trailer whenever towing above 3,000 lb $(1,361~\mathsf{k g})$ . A sway control device is recommended for all towing above 2,000 lb $(907~\mathrm{kg})$ . Sway control devices are not offered by NISSAN. See a professional trailer/hitch outlet for a properly designed sway control device for your trailer.  

# TOWING SAFETY  

# Trailer hitch  

Choose a proper hitch for your vehicle and trailer. A genuine NISSAN trailer hitch is available from a NISSAN dealer. Make sure the trailer hitch is securely attached to the vehicle to help avoid personal injury or property damage due to sway caused by crosswinds, rough road surfaces or passing trucks.  

# WARNING  

Choose the proper class hitch ball based on the trailer weight.   
The diameter of the threaded shank of the hitch ball must be matched to the ball mount hole diameter. The hitch ball shank should be no more than $1/16^{\prime\prime}$ smaller than the hole in the ball mount.   
The threaded shank of the hitch ball must be long enough to be properly secured to the ball mount. There should be at least 2 threads showing beyond the lock washer and nut.  

Class I hitch  

Class I trailer hitch equipment (receiver, ball mount and hitch ball) can be used to tow trailers of a maximum weight of 2,000 lb $(907~\mathsf{k g})$ .  

# Class II hitch  

Class II trailer hitch equipment (receiver, ball mount and hitch ball) can be used to tow trailers of a maximum weight of 3,500 lb $(1,588~\mathsf{k g})$ .  

# CAUTION  

Trailer hitch components have specific weight ratings. Your vehicle may be capable of towing a trailer heavier than the weight rating of the hitch components. Never exceed the weight rating of the hitch components. Doing so can cause serious personal injury or property damage.  

Hitch ball  

Choose a hitch ball of the proper size and weight rating for your trailer:  

The required hitch ball size is stamped on most trailer couplers. Most hitch balls also have the size printed on top of the ball.  

# Sway control device  

Sudden maneuvers, wind gusts and buffeting caused by other vehicles can affect trailer handling. Sway control devices may be used to help control these affects. If you choose to use one, contact a reputable trailer hitch supplier to make sure the sway control device will work with the vehicle, hitch, trailer and the trailer’s brake system. Follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer for installing and using the sway control device.  

Use hitches designed for your vehicle when towing. Check with your NISSAN dealer for availability of suitable genuine NISSAN hitches. The hitch should not be attached to or affect the operation of the impact-absorbing bumper. Do not use axle-mounted hitches. Do not modify the vehicle exhaust system, brake system, etc. to install a trailer hitch. To reduce the possibility of additional damage if your vehicle is struck from the rear, where practical, remove the hitch and/or receiver when not in use. After the hitch  

is removed, seal the bolt holes to prevent exhaust fumes, water or dust from entering the passenger compartment.   
Regularly check that all trailer hitch mounting bolts are securely mounted.  

# Tire pressures  

When towing a trailer, inflate the vehicle tires to the recommended cold tire pressure indicated on the Tire and Loading Information label. Trailer tire condition, size, load rating and proper inflation pressure should be in accordance with the trailer and tire manufacturers’ specifications.  

# Safety chains  

Always use a suitable chain between your vehicle and the trailer. The safety chains should be crossed and should be attached to the hitch, not to the vehicle bumper or axle. The safety chains can be attached to the bumper if the hitch ball is mounted to the bumper. Be sure to leave enough slack in the chains to permit turning corners.  

Trailer lights  

# CAUTION  

When splicing into the vehicle electrical system, a commercially available power-type module/converter must be used to provide power for all trailer lighting. This unit uses the vehicle battery as a direct power source for all trailer lights while using the vehicle tail light, stoplight and turn signal circuits as a signal source. The module/converter must draw no more than 15 milliamps from the stop and tail lamp circuits. Using a module/converter that exceeds these power requirements may damage the vehicle’s electrical system. See a reputable trailer dealer to obtain the proper equipment and to have it installed.  

Trailer lights should comply with federal and/or local regulations. For assistance in hooking up trailer lights, contact a NISSAN dealer or reputable trailer dealer.  

# Trailer brakes  

If your trailer is equipped with a braking system, make sure it conforms to federal and/or local regulations and that it is properly installed.  

# WARNING  

Never connect a trailer brake system directly to the vehicle brake system.  

# Pre-towing tips  

Be certain your vehicle maintains a level position when a loaded or unloaded trailer is hitched. Do not drive the vehicle if it has an abnormal nose-up or nose-down condition; check for improper tongue load, overload, worn suspension or other possible causes of either condition.   
Always secure items in the trailer to prevent load shift while driving.   
Keep the cargo load as low as possible in the trailer to keep the trailer center of gravity low.   
Load the trailer so approximately $60\%$ of the trailer load is in the front half and $40\%$ is in the back half. Also make sure the load is balanced side to side. Check your hitch, trailer tire pressure, vehicle tire pressure, trailer light operation, and trailer wheel lug nuts every time you attach a trailer to the vehicle.   
Be certain your rearview mirrors conform to all federal, state or local regulations. If not, install any mirrors required for towing before driving the vehicle.   
Determine the overall height of the vehicle and trailer so the required clearance is known.  

# Trailer towing tips  

In order to gain skill and an understanding of the vehicle’s behavior, you should practice turning, stopping and backing up in an area which is free from traffic. Steering stability, and braking performance will be somewhat different than under normal driving conditions.  

Always secure items in the trailer to prevent load shift while driving. Lock the trailer hitch coupler with a pin or lock to prevent the coupler from inadvertently becoming unlatched.   
. Avoid abrupt starts, acceleration or stops.   
. Avoid sharp turns or lane changes. Always drive your vehicle at a moderate speed. Some states or provinces have specific speed limits for vehicles that are  

towing trailers. Obey the local speed limits. When backing up, hold the bottom of the steering wheel with one hand. Move your hand in the direction in which you want the trailer to go. Make small corrections and back up slowly. If possible, have someone guide you when you are backing up.  

Always block the wheels on both vehicle and trailer when parking. Parking on a slope is not recommended; however, if you must do so:  

# CAUTION  

If you move the shift lever to the P (Park) position before blocking the wheels and applying the parking brake, transmission damage could occur.  

1. Apply and hold the brake pedal.   
2. Have someone place blocks on the downhill side of the vehicle and trailer wheels.   
3. After the wheel blocks are in place, slowly release the brake pedal until the blocks absorb the vehicle load.   
4. Apply the parking brake.   
5. Shift the transmission into P (Park).  

6. Turn off the engine.  

To drive away:   
1. Apply and hold the brake pedal.   
2. Start the engine.   
3. Shift the transmission into gear.   
4. Release the parking brake. Drive slowly until the vehicle and trailer are clear from the blocks.   
6. Apply and hold the brake pedal.   
7. Have someone retrieve and store the blocks. When going down a hill, shift into a lower gear and use the engine braking effect. When going up a long grade, downshift the transmission to a lower gear and reduce speed to reduce chances of engine overloading and/or overheating. If the engine coolant rises to an extremely high temperature when the air conditioning system is on, turn off the air conditioner. Coolant heat can be additionally vented by opening the windows, switching the fan control to high and setting the temperature control to the HOT position. Trailer towing requires more fuel than normal circumstances. Avoid towing a trailer for the first 500 miles $(800~\mathsf{k m})$ . Have your vehicle serviced more often than at intervals specified in the recommended maintenance schedule in the NISSAN Service and Maintenance Guide.   
When making a turn, your trailer wheels will be closer to the inside of the turn than your vehicle wheels. To compensate for this, make a larger than normal turning radius during the turn.   
Crosswinds and rough roads will adversely affect vehicle/trailer handling, possibly causing vehicle sway. When being passed by larger vehicles, be prepared for possible changes in crosswinds that could affect vehicle handling. If swaying does occur, firmly grip the steering wheel, steer straight ahead, and immediately (but gradually) reduce vehicle speed. This combination will help stabilize the vehicle. Never increase speed.  

Do the following if the trailer begins to sway:  

1. Take your foot off the accelerator pedal to allow the vehicle to coast and steer as straight ahead as the road conditions allow. This combination will help stabilize the vehicle. . Do not correct trailer sway by steering or applying the brakes.  

2. When the trailer sway stops, gently apply the brakes and pull to the side of the road in a safe area.   
3. Try to rearrange the trailer load so it is balanced as described earlier in this section. Be careful when passing other vehicles. Passing while towing a trailer requires considerably more distance than normal passing. Remember the length of the trailer must also pass the other vehicle before you can safely change lanes. Down shift the transmission to a lower gear for engine braking when driving down steep or long hills. This will help slow the vehicle without applying the brakes. Avoid holding the brake pedal down too long or too frequently. This could cause the brakes to overheat, resulting in reduced braking efficiency. Increase your following distance to allow for greater stopping distances while towing a trailer. Anticipate stops and brake gradually. Do not use cruise control while towing a trailer. Some states or provinces have specific regulations and speed limits for vehicles that are towing trailers. Obey the local speed limits. Check your hitch, trailer wiring harness connections, and trailer wheel lug nuts after 50 miles $(80k m)$ of travel and at every break.   
When stopped in traffic for long periods of time in hot weather, put the vehicle in the P (Park) position.   
When launching a boat, don’t allow the water level to go over the exhaust tail pipe or rear bumper.   
Make sure you disconnect the trailer lights before backing the trailer into the water or the trailer lights may burn out.  

When towing a trailer, the transmission fluid should be changed more frequently. For additional information, see the $\mathfrak{s}_{8}$ Maintenance and do-it-yourself” section earlier in this manual.  

# UNIFORM TIRE QUALITY GRADING  

# FLAT TOWING  

Towing your vehicle with all four wheels on the ground is sometimes called flat towing. This method is sometimes used when towing a vehicle behind a recreational vehicle, such as a motor home.  

# CAUTION  

Failure to follow these guidelines can result in severe transmission damage.   
Whenever flat towing your vehicle, always tow forward, never backward.   
DO NOT tow any continuously variable transmission vehicle with all four wheels on the ground (flat towing). Doing so WILL DAMAGE internal transmission parts due to lack of transmission lubrication.   
For emergency towing procedures refer to “Towing recommended by NISSAN” (P.6-15) of this manual.  

# Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)  

To tow a vehicle equipped with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), an appropriate vehicle dolly MUST be placed under the towed vehicle’s driving wheels. Always follow the dolly manufacturer’s recommendations when using their product.  

DOT (Department Of Transportation) Quality Grades: All passenger car tires must conform to federal safety requirements in addition to these grades.  

Quality grades can be found where applicable on the tire sidewall between tread shoulder and maximum section width. For example:  

# Treadwear 200 Traction AA Temperature A TREADWEAR  

The treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course. For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half  

(1 1/2) times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance of tires depends upon actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices and differences in road characteristics and climate.  

# TRACTION AA, A, B AND C  

The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B and C. Those grades represent the tire’s ability to stop on wet pavement as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C may have poor  

# EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM WARRANTY  

traction performance.  

# WARNING  

The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.  

# TEMPERATURE A, B AND C  

Your NISSAN is covered by the following emission warranties.  

The temperature grades A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire’s resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. The grade C corresponds to a level of performance which all passenger car tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel than the minimum required by law.  

# WARNING  

The temperature grade for this tire is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded. Excessive speed, under-inflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat build-up and possible tire failure.

# READINESS FOR INSPECTION/ MAINTENANCE (I/M) TEST  

Due to legal requirements in some states/areas or provinces, your vehicle may be required to be in what is called the “ready condition” for an Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) test of the emission control system.  

The vehicle is set to the “ready condition” when it is driven through certain driving patterns. Usually, the “ready condition” can be obtained by ordinary usage of the vehicle.  

If a powertrain system component is repaired or the battery is disconnected, the vehicle may be reset to a “not ready condition”. Before taking the I/M test, check the vehicle’s inspection/ maintenance test readiness condition. Place the ignition switch in the ON position without starting the engine. If the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) comes on steady for 20 seconds and then blinks for 10 seconds, the I/M test condition is “not ready”. If the MIL does not blink after 20 seconds, the I/M test condition is “ready”.  

Contact a NISSAN dealer to set “ready condition” or to prepare the vehicle for testing.  

This vehicle is equipped with an Event Data Recorder (EDR). The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations, such as an air bag deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist in understanding how a vehicle’s systems performed. The EDR is designed to record data related to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as:  

How various systems in your vehicle were operating; Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were buckled/fastened; How far (if at all) the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or brake pedal; and, . How fast the vehicle was traveling. . Sounds are not recorded.  

These data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur.  

NOTE: EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a nontrivial crash situation occurs; no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no personal data (e.g. name, gender, age and crash location) are recorded. However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation.  

To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer and NISSAN dealer, other parties, such as law enforcement, that have the special equipment, can read the information if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR. EDR data will only be accessed with the consent of the vehicle owner or lessee or as otherwise required or permitted by law.

# GAS STATION INFORMATION  

# FUEL INFORMATION:  

Use unleaded regular gasoline with an octane rating of at least 87 AKI (Anti-Knock Index) number (Research octane number 91).  

# CAUTION  

Using a fuel other than that specified could adversely affect the emission control system, and may also affect warranty coverage.   
Under no circumstances should a leaded gasoline be used, because this will damage the three-way catalyst.   
Do not use E-15 or E-85 fuel in your vehicle. Your vehicle is not designed to run on E-15 or E-85 fuel. Using E15 or E-85 fuel in a vehicle not specifically designed for E-15 or E85 fuel can adversely affect the emission control devices and systems of the vehicle. Damage caused by such fuel is not covered by the NISSAN new vehicle limited warranty.  

U.S. government regulations require ethanol dispensing pumps to be identified by a small, square, orange and black label with the common abbreviation or the appropriate percentage for that region.  

# ENGINE OIL RECOMMENDATION:  

Genuine NISSAN engine oil or equivalent Engine oil with API Certification Mark, Viscosity SAE 0W-20  

See “Capacities and recommended fluids/lubricants” (P.9-2) for engine oil and oil filter recommendation.  

# COLD TIRE PRESSURES:  

The label is typically located on the driver side center pillar or on the driver’s door. For additional information, see “Wheels and tires” (P.8-30).  

# NEW VEHICLE BREAK-IN PROCE-DURES RECOMMENDATION:  

During the first 1,200 miles $(2,000~\mathsf{k m})$ of vehicle use, follow the recommendations outlined in the “Break-in schedule” (P.5-25) of this Owner’s Manual. Follow these recommendations for the future reliability and economy of your new vehicle.
